<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The United States Government doesn't
appear very anxious to claim its property,
does it, sir?”</span> asked Captain Jack
Benson.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The speaker was a boy of sixteen, attired in a
uniform much after the pattern commonly worn
by yacht captains. The insignia of naval rank
were conspicuously absent.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Now, that I've had the good luck to sell the
'Pollard' to the Navy,”</span> responded Jacob Farnum,
principal owner of the shipbuilding yard,
<span class="tei tei-q">“I'm not disposed to grumble if the Government
prefers to store its property here for a while.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet the young shipbuilder—he was a man in
his early thirties, who had inherited this shipbuilding
business from his father—allowed his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page008">[pg 008]</span><a name="Pg008" id="Pg008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
eyes to twinkle in a way that suggested there
was something else behind his words.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jack Benson saw that twinkle, but he did not
ask questions. If the shipbuilder knew more
than he was prepared to tell, it was not for his
young captain to ask for information that was
not volunteered.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second boy present, also in uniform, Hal
Hastings by name, had not spoken in five minutes.
That was like Hal. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">He</span></span> was the engineer
of the submarine torpedo boat, <span class="tei tei-q">“Pollard.”</span>
Jack was captain of the same craft, and could
do all the talking.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jacob Farnum sat back, sideways, at his rolltop
desk. On top of the desk lay stacked a
voluminous though neat pile of papers, letters,
telegrams and memoranda that some rival builders
of submarine torpedo boats might have been
willing to pay much for the privilege of examining.
For, at the present moment, there was
fierce competition in the air between rival
American builders of submarine fighting craft
designed for the United States Navy. Even
foreign builders and inventors were clamoring
for recognition. Yet just now the reorganized
Pollard Submarine Boat Company stood at the
top of the line. It had made the last sale to the
United States Navy Department.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this moment, out in the little harbor that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page009">[pg 009]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was a part of the shipyard, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Pollard”</span> rode
gently at anchor. She was the first submarine
torpedo boat built at this yard, after the designs
of David Pollard, the inventor, a close personal
friend of Jacob Farnum.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Moreover, the second boat, named the <span class="tei tei-q">“Farnum,”</span>
had just been launched and put in commission,
ready at an hour's notice to take the sea
in search of floating enemies of the United
States.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The United States will take its boat one of
these days, Captain,”</span> Mr. Farnum continued,
after lighting a cigar. <span class="tei tei-q">“By the way, did Dave
tell you the name we are thinking of for the
third boat, now on the stocks?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Dave”</span> was Mr. Pollard, the inventor of the
Pollard Submarine boat.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No, sir,”</span> Captain Jack replied.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“We have thought,”</span> resumed Mr. Farnum,
quietly, after blowing out a ring of smoke, <span class="tei tei-q">“of
calling the third boat, now building, the 'Benson.'”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The—the—what, sir?”</span> stammered Jack,
flushing and rising.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Now, don't get excited, lad,”</span> laughed the
shipbuilder.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But—but—naming a boat for the United
States Navy after me, sir—”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Captain Jack's face flushed crimson.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg 010]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Of course, if you object—”</span> smiled Mr. Farnum,
then paused.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Object? You know I don't, sir. But I am
afraid the idea is going to my head,”</span> laughed
Jack, his face still flushed. <span class="tei tei-q">“The very idea of
there being in the United States Navy a fine and
capable craft named after me—”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, if the Navy folks object,”</span> laughed Farnum,
<span class="tei tei-q">“then they'll change the name quickly
enough. You understand, lad, the names we
give to our boats last only until the craft are
sold. The Navy people can change those names
if they please.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It will be a handsome compliment to me,
Mr. Farnum. More handsome than deserved, I
fear.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Deserved, well enough,”</span> retorted the shipbuilder.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Dave Pollard and I are well enough
satisfied that, if it hadn't been for you youngsters,
and the superb way in which you handled
our first boat, Dave and I would still be sitting
on the anxious bench in the ante-rooms of the
Navy Department at Washington.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, I don't deserve to have a boat named
after me any more than Hal does, or Eph
Somers.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Give us time, won't you, Captain?”</span> pleaded
Jacob Farnum, his face straight, but his eyes
laughing. <span class="tei tei-q">“We expect to build at least five
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page011">[pg 011]</span><a name="Pg011" id="Pg011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
boats. If we didn't, this yard never would have
been fitted for the present work, and you three
boys, who've done so handsomely by us,
wouldn't each own, as you now do, ten shares of
stock in this company. Never fear; there'll be
a 'Hastings' and a 'Somers' added to our fleet
one of these days—even though some of our
boats have to be sold to foreign governments.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“If a boat named the 'Hastings' were sold to
some foreign government,”</span> laughed Jack Benson,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Hal, here, wouldn't say much about it.
But call a boat named the 'Somers,' after Eph,
and then sell it, say, to the Germans or the
Japanese, and all of Eph's American gorge
would come to the surface. I'll wager he'd
scheme to sink any submarine torpedo boat,
named after him, that was sold to go under a
foreign flag.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I hope we'll never have to sell any of our
boats to foreign governments,”</span> replied Jacob
Farnum, earnestly. <span class="tei tei-q">“And we won't either, if
the United States Government will give us half
a show.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“That's just the trouble,”</span> grumbled Hal
Hastings, breaking into the talk, at last. <span class="tei tei-q">“Confound
it, why don't the people of this country
run their government more than they do?
Four-fifths of the inventors who get up great
things that would put the United States on top,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page012">[pg 012]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and keep us there, have to go abroad to find a
market for their inventions! If I could invent
a cannon to-day that would give all the power
on earth to the nation owning it, would the
American Government buy it from me? No,
sir! I'd have to sell the cannon to England,
Germany or Japan—or else starve while Congress
was talking of doing something about it
in the next session. Mr. Farnum, you have the
finest, and the only real submarine torpedo boat.
Yet, if you want to go on building and selling
these craft, you'll have to dispose of most of
them abroad.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I hope not,”</span> responded the shipbuilder,
solemnly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having said his say, Hal subsided. He was
likely not to speak again for an hour. As a
class, engineers, having to listen much to noisy
machinery, are themselves silent.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was well along in the afternoon, a little past
the middle of October. For our three young
friends, Jack, Hal and Eph, things were dull
just at the present moment. They were drawing
their salaries from the Pollard company, yet
of late there had been little for them to do.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet the three submarine boys knew that big
things were in the air. David Pollard was
away, presumably on important business.
Jacob Farnum was not much given to speaking
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page013">[pg 013]</span><a name="Pg013" id="Pg013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of plans until he had put them through to the
finish. Some big deal was at present <span class="tei tei-q">“on”</span>
with the Government. That much the submarine
boys knew by intuition. They felt,
therefore, that, at any moment, they were likely
to be called into action—to be called upon for
big things.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As Jack and Hal sat in the office, silent, while
Jacob Farnum turned to his desk to scan one of
the papers lying there, the door opened. A boy
burst in, waving a yellow envelope.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Operator said to hustle this wire to you,”</span>
shouted the boy, panting a bit. <span class="tei tei-q">“Said it might
be big news for Farnum. So I ran all the
way.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jacob Farnum took the yellow envelope,
opening it and glancing hastily through the
contents.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></span> pretty good news,”</span> assented the shipbuilder,
a smile wreathing his face. <span class="tei tei-q">“This is
for you, messenger.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“This”</span> proved to be a folded dollar bill.
The messenger took the money eagerly, then
demanded, more respectfully:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Any answer, sir?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Not at this moment, thank you,”</span> replied Mr.
Farnum. <span class="tei tei-q">“That is all; you may go, boy.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Plainly the boy who had brought the telegram
was disappointed over not getting some
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page014">[pg 014]</span><a name="Pg014" id="Pg014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
inkling of the secret. All Dunhaven, in fact,
was wildly agog over any news that affected the
Farnum yard. For, though the torpedo boat
building industry was now known under the
Pollard name, after the inventor of these boats,
the yard itself still went under the Farnum
name that young Farnum had inherited from
his father.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While Jacob Farnum is reading the despatch
carefully, for a better understanding, let us
speak for a moment of Captain Jack Benson
and his youthful comrades and chums.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Readers of the first volume in this series,
<span class="tei tei-q">“The Submarine Boys on Duty,”</span> remember
how Jack Benson and Hal Hastings strayed into
the little seaport town of Dunhaven one hot
summer day, and how they learned that it was
here that the then unknown but much-talked-about
Pollard submarine was being built. Both
Jack and Hal had been well trained in machine
shops; they had spent much time aboard salt
water power craft, and so felt a wild desire to
work at the Farnum yard, and to make a study
of submarine craft in general.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">How they succeeded in getting their start in
the Farnum yard, every reader of the preceding
volumes knows; how, too, Eph Somers, a
native of Dunhaven, managed to <span class="tei tei-q">“cheek”</span> his
way aboard the craft after she had been
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg 015]</span><a name="Pg015" id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
launched, and how he had always since managed
to remain there.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our same older readers will remember the
thrilling experiences of this boyish trio during
the early trials of the new submarine torpedo
boat, both above and below the surface. These
readers will remember, also, for instance, the
great prank played by the boys on the watch
officer of one of the stateliest battleships of the
Navy.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Readers of the second volume, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Submarine
Boys' Trial Trip,”</span> will recall, among
other things, the desperate efforts made by
George Melville, the capitalist, aided by the latter's
disagreeable son, Don, to acquire stealthy
control of the submarine building company, and
their efforts to oust Jack, Hal and Eph from
their much-prized employment. These readers
will remember how Jack and his comrades
spoiled the Melville plans, and how Captain
Jack and his friends handled the <span class="tei tei-q">“Pollard”</span> so
splendidly, in the presence of a board of Navy
officers, that the United States Government was
induced to buy that first submarine craft.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After that sale, each of the three boys received,
in addition to his regular pay, a bank
account of a thousand dollars and ten shares of
stock in the new company. Moreover, Messrs.
Farnum and Pollard had felt wholly justified in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page016">[pg 016]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
promising these talented, daring, hustling submarine
boys an assured and successful future.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jacob Farnum at last looked up from the final
reading of the telegram in his hands. Captain
Jack Benson's gaze was fixed on his employer's
face. Hal Hastings was looking out of a window,
with almost a bored look in his eyes.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You young men wanted action,”</span> announced
Mr. Farnum, quietly. <span class="tei tei-q">“I think you'll get it.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Soon?”</span> questioned Jack, eagerly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Immediately, or a minute or two later,”</span>
laughed the shipbuilder.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I'm ready,”</span> declared Captain Jack, rising.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It'll take you a little time to hear about it
all and digest it, so you may as well be seated
again,”</span> declared Farnum.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hal, too, wandered back to his chair.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You've been wondering how much longer
the Government would leave the 'Pollard'
here,”</span> went on Mr. Farnum. <span class="tei tei-q">“I am informed
that the gunboat 'Hudson' is on her way here,
to take over the 'Pollard.'”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What are the Navy folks going to do?”</span> demanded
Captain Jack, all but wrathfully. <span class="tei tei-q">“Do
they propose to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tow</span></span> that splendid little craft
away?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Hardly that, I imagine,”</span> replied Farnum.
<span class="tei tei-q">“It's the custom of the United States Navy, you
know, to send a gunboat along with every two
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page017">[pg 017]</span><a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
or three submarines. They call the larger craft
the 'parent boat.' The parent boat looks out
for any submarine craft that may become disabled.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The cheek of it,”</span> vented Jack, disgustedly.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Why, sir, I'd volunteer to take the 'Pollard,'
unassisted, around the world, if she could carry
fuel enough for such a trip.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But the Navy hasn't been accustomed to
such capable submarine boats as ours, you
know,”</span> replied Mr. Farnum. <span class="tei tei-q">“Hence the
parent boat.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Parent boat?”</span> interjected Hal Hastings,
with his quiet smile. <span class="tei tei-q">“You might call it the
'Dad' boat, so to speak.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Farnum laughed, then continued:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“A naval crew will take possession of the
'Pollard,' and the craft will proceed, under the
care of the Dad boat”</span>—with a side glance of
amusement at Hal—<span class="tei tei-q">“to the United States
Naval Academy at Annapolis.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Annapolis—where they train the naval
cadets, the midshipmen, into United States
Naval officers? Oh, how I'd like to go there!”</span>
breathed Captain Jack Benson, eagerly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“As a cadet in the Navy, do you mean?”</span>
asked Mr. Farnum.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, that would have been well enough,”</span>
assented Jack, <span class="tei tei-q">“before I had such a chance in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page018">[pg 018]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
your submarine service. No; I mean I'd like
to see Annapolis. I'd like to watch the midshipmen
at their training, and see the whole
naval life there.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It's too bad every fellow can't have his wish
gratified as easily,”</span> continued Jacob Farnum.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Do you mean we're going to Annapolis,
too?”</span> asked Jack Benson, his eyes glowing.
Even Hal Hastings sat up straighter in his
chair, watching the shipbuilder's face closely.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> nodded Jacob Farnum. <span class="tei tei-q">“Permission
has been granted for me to send our second
boat, the 'Farnum,' along with the 'Pollard'—both
under the care of the—”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The Dad boat,”</span> laughed Hastings.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes; that will give us a chance to have the
'Farnum' studied most closely by some of the
most capable officers in the United States Navy.
It ought to mean, presently, the sale of the
'Farnum' to the Government.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“That's just what it will mean,”</span> promised
Captain Jack, <span class="tei tei-q">“if any efforts of ours can make
the Navy men more interested in the boat.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You three youngsters are likely to be at
Annapolis for some time,”</span> went on Mr. Farnum.
<span class="tei tei-q">“In fact—but don't let your heads become
too enlarged by the news, will you?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hal, quiet young Hal, neatly hid a yawn behind
one hand, while Benson answered for both:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page019">[pg 019]</span><a name="Pg019" id="Pg019" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“We're already wearing the largest-sized
caps manufactured, Mr. Farnum. Don't tempt
us too far, please!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, you boys are safe from the ordinary
perils of vanity, or your heads would have burst
long ago. Well, then, when you arrive at Annapolis,
you three are to act as civilian instructors
to the middies. You three are to teach the
midshipmen of the United States Navy the
principles on which the Pollard type of boat is
run. There; I've told you the whole news.
What do you think of it?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Farnum's cigar having burned low, he
tossed it away, then leaned back as he lighted
another weed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What do we think, sir?”</span> echoed Captain
Jack, eagerly. <span class="tei tei-q">“Why, we think we're in sight
of the very time of our lives! Annapolis! And
to teach the middies how to run a 'Pollard' submarine.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“How soon are we likely to have to start,
sir!”</span> asked Hal Hastings, after a silence that
lasted a few moments.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Whenever the 'Hudson' shows up along this
coast, and the officer in command of her gives
the word. That may be any hour, now.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Then we'd better find Eph,”</span> suggested
Captain Jack, <span class="tei tei-q">“and pass him the word. Won't
Eph Somers dance a jig for delight, though?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page020">[pg 020]</span><a name="Pg020" id="Pg020" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Yes; we'd better look both boats over at
once,”</span> replied Mr. Farnum, picking up his hat.
<span class="tei tei-q">“And we'll leave word for Grant Andrews and
some of his machinists to inspect both craft
with us. There may be a few things that will
need to be done.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As they left the office, crossing the yard, Captain
Jack Benson and Hal Hastings felt exactly
as though they were walking on air. Even
Hal, quiet as he was, had caught the joy-infection
of these orders to proceed to Annapolis.
To be sent to the United States Naval Academy
on a tour of instruction is what officers of the
Navy often call <span class="tei tei-q">“the prize detail.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Farnum and his two youthful companions
went, first of all, to the long, shed-like building
in which the third submarine craft to be
turned out at this yard was now being built.
From inside came the noisy clang of hammers
against metal. The shipbuilder stepped inside
alone, but soon came out, nodding. The three
now continued on their way down to the little
harbor. All of a sudden the three stopped
short, almost with a jerk, in the same second,
as though pulled by a string.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At exactly the same instant Jacob Farnum,
Captain Jack Benson and Engineer Hal Hastings
put up their hands to rub their eyes.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Their senses had told them truly, however.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg 021]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
While the <span class="tei tei-q">“Pollard”</span> rode serenely at her moorings,
the <span class="tei tei-q">“Farnum,”</span> the second boat to be
launched, was nowhere to be seen!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What on earth has happened to the other
submarine?”</span> gasped the shipbuilder, as soon
as he could somewhat control his voice.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What, indeed?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was not a sign of her. At least, she
had not sunk at her moorings, for the buoys
floated in their respective places, with no manner
of tackle attached to them.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“A submarine boat can't slip its own cables
and vanish without human hands!”</span> gasped the
staggered Jack Benson.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“There's something uncanny about this,”</span>
muttered Hal Hastings.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jacob Farnum stood rooted to the spot, opening
and closing his hands in a way that testified
plainly to the extent of his bewilderment.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Jack Benson was the first of the trio to
move.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Without a word he broke into a run,
heading for the narrow little shingle of beach.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Got an idea, Captain?”</span> shouted Jacob Farnum,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page022">[pg 022]</span><a name="Pg022" id="Pg022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
darting after his young submarine
skipper.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, sir!”</span> floated back over Jack's shoulder.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Then what's at the bottom—”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Eph and the boat, both together, or I miss
my guess,”</span> Captain Jack shouted back as he
halted at the water's edge, where a rowboat lay
hauled up on the shore.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jacob Farnum's face showed suddenly pallid
as he, also, reached the beach. Hal, who was
in the rear, did not seem so much startled.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Do you think Eph has gone off on a cruise
all alone?—that he has come to any harm?”</span>
gasped the shipbuilder.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I don't know, but I'm not going to worry
a mite about Eph Somers until I have to,”</span> retorted
Jack Benson, easily.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Eph can generally take care of himself,”</span>
added Hal Hastings. <span class="tei tei-q">“He rarely falls into
any kind of scrape that he can't climb out
of.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But this is a bad time for him to take the
'Farnum' and cruise away,”</span> objected the owner
of the yard. <span class="tei tei-q">“The 'Hudson' may be here at
any hour, you know, and we ought to be ready
for orders.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As he spoke, Mr. Farnum scanned the horizon
away to the south, out over the sea.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“There's a line of smoke, now, and not many
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page023">[pg 023]</span><a name="Pg023" id="Pg023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
miles away,”</span> he announced. <span class="tei tei-q">“It may, as likely
as not, be smoke from the 'Hudson's' pipe.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Going out with us, sir?”</span> inquired Captain
Jack Benson, as Hal took his place at a pair of
oars.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> nodded the owner of the yard, dropping
into a seat at the stern of the boat, after
which Benson pushed off at the bow.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Down on the seashore, on this day just past
the middle of October, the air was keen and
brisk. There had been frost for several nights
past. Sleighing might be looked for in another
month.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Cable's gone from this buoy,”</span> declared Captain
Jack, as Hal rowed close. <span class="tei tei-q">“Over to the
other one, old fellow.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here, too, the cable was missing. Evidently
the <span class="tei tei-q">“Farnum”</span> had made a clean get-away. If
there had been any accident, it must have taken
place after the new submarine boat had slipped
away from her moorings.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Humph!”</span> grunted Jack, scanning the sea.
<span class="tei tei-q">“No sign of the boat anywhere. Eph may be
anywhere within twenty miles of here.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Or within twenty feet, either,”</span> grinned Hal,
looking down into the waters that were lead-colored
under the dull autumn sky.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What are we going to do, Captain?”</span> inquired
Jacob Farnum. <span class="tei tei-q">“There are Grant Andrews
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page024">[pg 024]</span><a name="Pg024" id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and three of his machinists coming down
to the water.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I reckon, sir, we'd better put them aboard
the 'Pollard' first, sir,”</span> Benson suggested.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Farnum nodding, the boat was rowed in
to the shore and Andrews and his men were
put aboard the <span class="tei tei-q">“Pollard”</span> at the platform deck.
Captain Jack Benson unlocking the door to the
conning tower, was himself the first to disappear
down below. When he came back he carried
a line to which was attached a heavy sounding-lead.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It won't take us long to sound the deep
spots in this little harbor,”</span> said the young skipper,
as he dropped down once more into the
bow of the shore boat. <span class="tei tei-q">“Row about, Hal, over
the places where the submarine could go below
out of sight.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As Hal rowed, Skipper Jack industriously
used the sounding-lead.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For twenty minutes nothing resulted from
this exploration. Then, all of a sudden, Benson
shouted:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Back water, Hal! Easy; rest on your oars.
Steady!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jack Benson raised the lead two or three
feet, then let it down again, playing it up and
down very much as a cod fisherman uses his
line and hook.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page025">[pg 025]</span><a name="Pg025" id="Pg025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“I'm hitting something, and it is hardly a
rock, either,”</span> declared young Benson. <span class="tei tei-q">“Pull
around about three points to starboard, Hal,
then steal barely forward.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again Benson played see-saw with his sounding-line
over the boat's gunwale.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“If my lead isn't hitting the 'Farnum,'”</span>
declared the young skipper, positively, <span class="tei tei-q">“then
it's the 'Farnum's' ghost. Hold steady, now,
Hal.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Immediately afterward, Benson caused the
lead fairly to dance a jig on whatever it touched
at bottom.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What's the good of that, anyway?”</span> demanded
Jacob Farnum.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You don't think I'm doing this just for fun,
do you, sir?”</span> asked Captain Jack, with a smile.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No; I know you generally have an object
when you do anything unusual,”</span> responded the
shipbuilder, good-humoredly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You know, of course, sir, that noises sound
with a good deal of exaggeration when you hear
them under water?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes; of course.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You also know that all three of us have
been practicing at telegraphy a good deal during
the past few weeks, because every man who
follows the sea ought to know how to send and
receive wireless messages at need.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page026">[pg 026]</span><a name="Pg026" id="Pg026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Yes; I know that, Benson.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, sir, I guess that the lead has been
hitting the top of the 'Farnum's' hull, and I've
been tapping out the signal—”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The signal, 'Come up—rush!'”</span> broke in
Hal, with an odd smile.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Right-o,”</span> nodded Jack Benson.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“How on earth did <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">you</span></span> know what the signal
was, Hastings?”</span> demanded Mr. Farnum.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, sir, I've been sitting so that I could
see Jack's arm. I've been reading, from the
motions of his right arm, the dots and dashes of
the Morse telegraph alphabet.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You youngsters certainly get me, for the
things you think of,”</span> laughed the shipyard's
owner.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And the 'Farnum,' or whatever it is, is coming
up,”</span> called Captain Jack, suddenly. <span class="tei tei-q">“I just
felt my lead slide down over the top of her hull.
Hard-a-starboard, Hal, and row hard,”</span> shouted
young Benson, breathlessly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Though Hastings obeyed immediately he was
barely an instant too soon. To his dismay, Mr.
Farnum saw something dark, unwieldy, rising
through the water. It appeared to be coming
up fairly under the stern of the shore boat,
threatening to overturn the little craft and
plunge them all into the icy water.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hal shot just out of the danger zone, though.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page027">[pg 027]</span><a name="Pg027" id="Pg027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Then a round little tower bobbed up out of the
water. Immediately afterward the upper third
of a long, cigar-shaped craft came up into view,
water rolling from her dripping sides, which
glistened brightly as the sun came out briefly
from behind a fall cloud.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the conning tower, through the thick plate
glass, the three people in the shore boat made
out the carroty-topped head and freckled,
good-humored, honest, homely face of Eph
Somers. The boat lay on the water, under no
headway, drifting slightly with the wind-driven
ripples. Then Eph raised the man-hole cover
of the top of the conning tower, thrusting out
his head to hail them.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Hey, you landsmen, do you know a buoy
from an umbrella?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Do <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">you</span></span> know the difference between a Sunday-school
text and petty larceny?”</span> retorted
Jack Benson, sternly. <span class="tei tei-q">“What do you mean by
taking the submarine without leave?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I've been experimenting—flirting with
science,”</span> responded Eph, loftily. <span class="tei tei-q">“Say, if you
landsmen know a buoy from a banana, get down
to the bow moorings of this steel mermaid, and
I'll pass you the bow cable. It's a heap easier
to lead this submarine horse out of the stall,
single-handed, than it is to take him back and
tie him.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page028">[pg 028]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Hal rowed easily to the buoy, while Eph, returning
to the steering wheel and the tower controls,
ran the <span class="tei tei-q">“Farnum,”</span> with just bare headway,
up to where he could toss the bow cable to
those waiting in the boat. A few moments later
the stern cable, also, was made fast, in such a
way as to allow a moderate swing to the bulky
steel craft.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Now, you can take me ashore, if you feel
like it,”</span> proposed Eph, standing on the platform
deck.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Not quite yet,”</span> returned Skipper Jack,
though the small boat lay alongside. <span class="tei tei-q">“We've
got some inspecting to do. But how did you get
on board in the first place?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, the night watchman was in the yard
for a few minutes, and I got him to put me on
board. I figured I could hail somebody else
when I was ready to go on shore.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But what on earth made you do such a
thing?”</span> demanded Captain Jack, in a low tone.
<span class="tei tei-q">“It's really more than you had a right to do,
Eph, without getting Mr. Farnum's permission.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, I've known you to take the 'Pollard'
and try something when Mr. Farnum wasn't
about,”</span> retorted Somers, looking surprised.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You never knew me to do it when I could
ask permission, although, as captain, I have the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page029">[pg 029]</span><a name="Pg029" id="Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
right to handle the boat. But that leave doesn't
extend to all the rest, Eph. What were you
doing down there, anyway?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, I came on board, and left the manhole
open for ten minutes,”</span> answered Somers.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Then I found the cabin thermometer standing
at 49 degrees. I wondered how much warmth
could be gained by going below the surface.
I had been down an hour and five minutes
when you began to signal with that sledge-hammer—”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Sounding-lead,”</span> Jack corrected him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, it sounded like a sledge-hammer, anyway,”</span>
grinned young Somers. <span class="tei tei-q">“While I was
down below I found that the temperature rose
four degrees.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Part of that was likely due to the warmth of
your body, and the heat of the breath you gave
off,”</span> hinted Benson.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You could have gotten it up to eighty
or ninety degrees by turning on the electric
heater far enough,”</span> suggested Hal.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I wanted to see whether it would be warmer
in the depths; wanted to find out how low I could
go and be able to do without heat in winter,”</span>
Somers retorted.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I could have told you that, from my reading,
without any experiment,”</span> retorted Skipper
Jack. <span class="tei tei-q">“Close your conning tower and go down
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page030">[pg 030]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a little way, and the temperature would gradually
rise a few degrees. That's because of the
absence of wind and draft. But, if you could
go down very, very deep without smashing the
boat under the water pressure, you'd find the
temperature falling quite a bit.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Where did you read all that?”</span> inquired
Eph, looking both astonished and sheepish.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Here,”</span> replied Jack, going to a small wall
book-case, taking down a book and turning
several pages before he stopped.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Just my luck,”</span> muttered Eph, disconsolately.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Here I've been dull as ditch-water
for an hour, trying to find out something new,
and it's all stated in a book printed—ten years
ago,”</span> he finished, after rapidly consulting the
title-page.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jacob Farnum had been no listener to this
conversation. Taking the marine glasses from
the conning tower, the shipbuilder was now well
forward on the platform deck, scanning what
was visible of the steam craft to the southward.
At last the yard's owner turned around to say:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I don't believe you young men can have
things ship-shape a second too soon. The craft
heading this way has a military mast forward.
She must be the 'Hudson.' If there's anything
to be done, hustle!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jack and Hal sprang below, to scan their respective
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page031">[pg 031]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
departments. Five minutes later Grant
Andrews hailed from the <span class="tei tei-q">“Pollard,”</span> and Eph
rowed over in the shore boat to ferry over the
machinists.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Half an hour later Andrews and his men had
put in the few needed touches aboard the newer
submarine boat. The sun, meanwhile, had gone
down, showing the hull of a naval vessel some
four miles off the harbor.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Darkness came on quickly, with a clouded sky.
As young Benson stepped on deck Grant Andrews
followed him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“All finished here, Grant?”</span> queried the
yard's owner.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, sir. There's mighty little chance to
do anything where Hal Hastings has charge of
the machinery.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“That's our gunboat out there, I think,”</span> went
on Mr. Farnum, pointing to where a white masthead
light and a red port light were visible,
about a mile away.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Dunhaven must be on the map, all right,
if a strange navigating officer knows how to
come so straight to the place,”</span> laughed Jack
Benson.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, you trust a United States naval officer
to find any place he has sailing orders for,”</span> returned
Jacob Farnum. <span class="tei tei-q">“I wonder if he'll
attempt to come into this harbor?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page032">[pg 032]</span><a name="Pg032" id="Pg032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“There's safe anchorage, if he wants to do
so,”</span> replied Captain Jack.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While Somers was busy putting the foreman
and the machinists ashore, Mr. Farnum, Jack
and Hal remained on the platform deck, watching
the approach of the naval vessel, which was
now plainly making for Dunhaven.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Suddenly, a broad beam of glaring white light
shot over the water, resting across the deck of
the <span class="tei tei-q">“Farnum.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I guess that fellow knows what he wants to
know, now,”</span> muttered Benson, blinking after
the strong glare had passed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“There, he has picked up the 'Pollard,' too,”</span>
announced Hastings. <span class="tei tei-q">“Now, that commander
must feel sure he has sighted the right place.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“There go the signal lights,”</span> cried Captain
Jack, suddenly. <span class="tei tei-q">“Hal, hustle below and turn
on the electric current for the signaling
apparatus.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Benson watched as, from the yards high
up on the gunboat's signaling mast, colored
electric lights glowed forth, twinkling briefly in
turn. This is the modern method of signaling
by sea at night.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“He wants to know,”</span> said Benson, to Mr.
Farnum, as he turned, <span class="tei tei-q">“whether there is safe
anchorage for a twelve-hundred-ton gunboat of
one hundred and ninety-five feet length.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page033">[pg 033]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Reaching the inside of the conning tower at a
bound, the young skipper rapidly manipulated
his own electric signaling control. There was
a low mast on the <span class="tei tei-q">“Farnum's”</span> platform deck,
a mast that could be unstepped almost in an
instant when going below surface. So Captain
Jack's counter-query beamed out in colors
through the night:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What's your draught?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Under present ballast, seventeen-eight,”</span>
came the answer from the gunboat's signal
mast.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Safe anchorage,”</span> Captain Jack signaled
back.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Can you meet us with a pilot?”</span> questioned
the on-coming gunboat.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> Captain Jack responded.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Do so,”</span> came the laconic request.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“That's all, Hal,”</span> the young skipper called,
through the engine room speaking tube. <span class="tei tei-q">“Want
to row me out and put me aboard the gunboat?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In another jiffy the two young chums had
put off in the boat, Hal at the oars, Jack at the
tiller ropes. The gunboat was now lying to,
some seven hundred yards off the mouth of the
little harbor. Hastings bent lustily to the oars,
sending the boat over the rocking water until
he was within a hundred yards of the steam
craft's bridge.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page034">[pg 034]</span><a name="Pg034" id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Gun boat ahoy!”</span> roared Hal, between his
hands. Then, by a slip of the tongue, and
wholly innocent of any intentional offense, he
bellowed:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Is that the 'Dad' boat?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What's that?”</span> came a sharp retort from
the gunboat's bridge. <span class="tei tei-q">“Don't try to be funny,
young man!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Beg your pardon, sir. That was a slip of
the tongue,”</span> Hal replied, meekly, as he colored.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Are you the gunboat 'Hudson?'”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No; I'm her commanding officer, young
man! Who in blazes are you?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I'm the goat, it seems,”</span> muttered Hastings,
under his breath. But, aloud, he replied:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I have the pilot you requested.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Then why don't you bring him on board?”</span>
came the sharp question. <span class="tei tei-q">“Did you think I
only wanted to look at a pilot?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“All right, sir. Shall I make fast to your
starboard side gangway?”</span> Hal called.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“In a hurry, young man!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“That's the naval style, I guess,”</span> murmured
Jack to his chum. <span class="tei tei-q">“No fooling in the talk. I
wonder if that fellow eats pie? Or is his temper
due to coffee?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Answering only with a quiet grin, Hal rowed
alongside the starboard side gangway. Jack,
waiting, sprang quickly to the steps, ascending,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page035">[pg 035]</span><a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
waving his hand to Hal as he went. Young
Hastings quickly shoved off, then bent to his
oars.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Where's the pilot?”</span> came a stern voice,
from the bridge, as Jack Benson's head showed
above the starboard rail.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I am the pilot, sir,”</span> Jack replied.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, you're a boy.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Guilty,”</span> Jack responded.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What does this fooling mean? You're not
old enough to hold a pilot's license.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By this time Benson was on the deck, immediately
under the bridge. A half dozen sailors,
forward, were eyeing him curiously.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I have no license, sir,”</span> Jack admitted.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Neither has anyone else at Dunhaven. For
that matter, the harbor's a private one, belonging
to the shipyard.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Hasn't Mr. Farnum a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">man</span></span> he can send
out?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No one who knows the harbor better than I
do, sir.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Who are you? What are you?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Jack Benson, sir. Captain of the Pollard
submarine boats.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why didn't you tell me that before?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The question came sharply, almost raspingly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Beg your pardon, sir, but you didn't ask
me,”</span> Jack replied.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page036">[pg 036]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Come up here, Benson,”</span> ordered the lieutenant
commander, in a loud voice intended to
drown out the subdued titter of some of the
sailors forward.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jack ascended to the bridge, to find himself
facing a six-footer in his early thirties. There
was a younger officer at the far end of the
bridge.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Does Mr. Farnum consider you capable of
showing us the way into the harbor?”</span> demanded
the commanding officer of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Hudson.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I think so, sir. He trusts me with his own
boats.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Then you are—”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Benson, Mr. Farnum's captain of the submarine
boats.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lieutenant Commander Mayhew gazed in astonishment
for a moment, then held out his
hand as he introduced himself, remarking:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I was told that I would find a very young
submarine commander here, but—”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You didn't expect to find one quite as
young,”</span> Jack finished, smiling.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No; I didn't. Mr. Trahern, I want you to
know Captain Jack Benson, of the Pollard
submarines.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ensign Trahern also shook hands with young
Benson.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page037">[pg 037]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“And now,”</span> went on the commander of the
<span class="tei tei-q">“Hudson,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“I think you may as well show us
the way into the harbor.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You'll want to go at little more than headway,
sir,”</span> Jack replied. <span class="tei tei-q">“The harbor is small,
though there's enough deep water for you. In
parts there are some sand ledges that the tide
washes up.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I can't allow you to pilot us, exactly, but
you'll indicate the course to me, won't you, Mr.
Benson?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <span class="tei tei-q">“mister”</span> was noticeable, now. Naval
officers are chary of their bestowal of the title
<span class="tei tei-q">“captain”</span> upon one who does not hold it in
the Army or Navy service.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At Mr. Mayhew's order the <span class="tei tei-q">“Hudson”</span> was
started slowly forward, the searchlight playing
about the entrance to the harbor.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“For your best anchorage, sir,”</span> declared
Captain Jack, after he had brought the gunboat
slowly into the harbor, <span class="tei tei-q">“you will do well
to anchor with that main arc-light dead ahead,
that shed over there on your starboard beam,
and the front end of the submarine shed about
four points off your port bow.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Mayhew slowly manœuvred his craft,
while men stood on the deck below, forward,
prepared to heave the bow anchors.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Go four points over to port, Mr. Trahern,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page038">[pg 038]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
instructed Mr. Mayhew. <span class="tei tei-q">“Now, back the engines—steady!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jack Benson opened his mouth wide. Then,
as he saw the way the <span class="tei tei-q">“Hudson”</span> was backing,
he suddenly called:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Slow speed ahead, quick, sir!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You said—”</span> began Mr. Mayhew.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Gr-r-r-r! The stern of the gunboat dug its
way into a sand ledge, lifting the stern considerably.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Slow speed ahead!”</span> rasped Lieutenant
Commander Mayhew, sharply.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the gunboat could not be budged. She
was stuck, stern on, fast in the sand-ledge.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Benson!”</span> uttered the lieutenant commander,
bitterly, <span class="tei tei-q">“I congratulate you. You've succeeded
in grounding a United States Naval
vessel!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There was so much of overwhelming
censure in the naval officer's tone that
Jack's spirit was stung to the quick.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It's your mistake, sir,”</span> he retorted. <span class="tei tei-q">“You
didn't follow the course I advised. You swung
the ship around to port, and—”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Silence, now, if you please, while men are
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page039">[pg 039]</span><a name="Pg039" id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
trying to get this vessel out of a scrape a boy
got her into,”</span> commanded Mr. Mayhem, sternly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jack flushed, then bit his tongue. In another
moment a pallor had succeeded the red in his
face.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was blamed for the disaster, and he was
not really at fault.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet, under the rebuke he had just received,
he did not feel it his place to retort further for
the present.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Mayhew and Mr. Trahern conferred in
low tones for a moment or two.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You may as well leave the bridge, young
man,”</span> resumed Mr. Mayhew, turning upon the
submarine boy. <span class="tei tei-q">“You are not likely to be of
any use here.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As Jack, burning inwardly with indignation,
though managing to keep outwardly calm, descended
to the deck below, he caught sight of
Hal Hastings, hovering near in the rowboat.
Hal signaled to learn whether he should put in
alongside to take off his chum, but Benson
shook his head.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Over on the <span class="tei tei-q">“Farnum”</span> the yard's owner and
Eph Somers watched wonderingly. They understood,
well enough, that the new, trim-looking
gunboat was in trouble, but they did not
know that Jack Benson was held at fault.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Down between decks the engines of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Hudson”</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page040">[pg 040]</span><a name="Pg040" id="Pg040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
were toiling hard to run the craft off out
of the sand. Then the machinery stopped. An
engineer officer came up from below. He and
Mr. Mayhew walked to the stern, while a seaman,
accompanying them, heaved the lead,
reading the soundings.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“We're stuck good and fast,”</span> remarked the
engineer officer. <span class="tei tei-q">“We can't drive off out of
that sand for the reason that the propellers are
buried in the grit. They'll hardly turn at all,
and, when they do, they only churn the sand
without driving us off.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Confound that ignoramus of a boy!”</span> muttered
Mr. Mayhew, walking slowly forward. It
was no pleasant situation for the lieutenant commander.
Having run his vessel ashore, he
knew himself likely to be facing a naval board
of inquiry.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hal, finding that the shore boat was not
wanted for the present, had rowed over to the
<span class="tei tei-q">“Farnum's”</span> moorings. Now Jacob Farnum
came alongside in the shore boat.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“May I speak with your watch officer?”</span> he
called.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I am the commanding officer,”</span> Mr. Mayhew
called down, in the cold, even, dulled voice
of a man in trouble.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I am Mr. Farnum, owner of the yard. May
I come on board?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page041">[pg 041]</span><a name="Pg041" id="Pg041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Be glad to have you,”</span> Lieutenant Commander
Mayhew responded.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So Mr. Farnum went nimbly up over the side.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“May I ask what is the trouble here, sir?”</span>
asked the yard's owner.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The trouble is,”</span> replied Mr. Mayhew, <span class="tei tei-q">“that
your enterprising boy pilot has run us aground—hard,
tight and fast!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jacob Farnum glanced swiftly at his young
captain. Jack shook his head briefly in dissent.
Jacob Farnum, with full confidence in his young
man, at once understood that there was more yet
to be learned.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Come up on the bridge, sir, if you will,”</span> requested
the commander of the gunboat, who was
a man of too good breeding to wish any dispute
before the men of the crew. <span class="tei tei-q">“You may come,
too, Benson.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jack followed the others, including the
engineer officer of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Hudson.”</span> Yet Benson
was clenching his hands, fighting a desperate
battle to get full command over himself. It
was hard—worse than hard—to be unjustly
accused.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jacob Farnum wished to keep on the pleasantest
terms with these officers of the Navy. At
the same time he was man enough to feel determined
that Jack, whether right or wrong, should
have a full chance to defend himself.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page042">[pg 042]</span><a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“I understand, sir,”</span> began Mr. Farnum,
<span class="tei tei-q">“that you attach some blame in this matter to
young Benson?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Perhaps he is not to be blamed too much, on
account of his extreme youth,”</span> responded Mr.
Mayhew.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Forget his youth altogether,”</span> urged Mr.
Farnum. <span class="tei tei-q">“Let us treat him as a man. I've
always found him one, in judgment, knowledge
and loyalty. Do you mind telling me, sir, in
what way he erred in bringing you in here?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“An error in giving his advice,”</span> replied
Mr. Mayhew. <span class="tei tei-q">“Or else it was ignorance of how
to handle a craft as large as this gunboat. For
my anchorage he told me—”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here the lieutenant commander repeated the
first part of Jack's directions correctly, but
wound up with:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“He advised me to throw my wheel over four
points to port.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Pardon me, sir,”</span> Jack broke in, unable to
keep still longer. <span class="tei tei-q">“What I said, or intended to
say, was to bring your vessel so that the forward
end of the submarine shed over there would be
four points off the port bow.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What did you hear Mr. Benson say, Mr.
Trahern?”</span> demanded the gunboat's commander,
turning to the ensign who had stood
with him on the bridge.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page043">[pg 043]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Why, sir, I understood the lad to say what
he states that he said.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You are sure of that, Mr. Trahern?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Unless my ears tricked me badly,”</span> replied
the ensign, <span class="tei tei-q">“Mr. Benson said just what he now
states. I wondered, sir, at your calling for slow
speed astern.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lieutenant Commander Mayhew gazed for
some moments fixedly at the face of Ensign
Trahern. Then, of a sudden, the gunboat's
commander, who was both an officer and a gentleman,
broke forth, contritely:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“As I think it over, I believe, myself, that
Benson advised as he now states he did. It was
my own error—I am sure of it now.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Wheeling about, Mayhew held out his right
hand.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Mr. Benson,”</span> he said, in a deep voice full of
regret, <span class="tei tei-q">“I was the one in error. I am glad to
admit it, even if tardily. Will you pardon my
too hasty censure?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Gladly, sir,”</span> Benson replied, gripping the
proffered hand. Jacob Farnum stood back,
wagging his head in a satisfied way. It had
been difficult for him to believe that his young
captain had been at fault in so simple a matter,
or in a harbor with which he was so intimately
acquainted.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As for the young man himself, the thing that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page044">[pg 044]</span><a name="Pg044" id="Pg044" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
touched him most deeply was the quick, complete
and manly acknowledgment of this lieutenant
commander.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Mr. Farnum,”</span> inquired the gunboat's commander,
<span class="tei tei-q">“have you any towboats about here
that can be used in helping me to get the 'Hudson'
off this sand ledge?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The only one in near waters, sir,”</span> replied
the yard's owner, <span class="tei tei-q">“is a craft, not so very much
larger than a launch, that ties up some three
miles down the coast. She's the boat I use when
I need any towing here. Of course, I have the
two torpedo boats, though their engines were
not constructed for towing work.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“May I offer a suggestion?”</span> asked Jack,
when the talk lagged.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I'll be glad to have you, Mr. Benson,”</span> replied
Mr. Mayhew, turning toward the submarine
boy.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Flood tide will be in in about two hours and
a half, sir,”</span> Benson followed up. <span class="tei tei-q">“That ought
to raise this vessel a good deal. Then, with the
towboat Mr. Farnum has mentioned, and with
such help as the engines of the submarines may
give, together with your own engines, Mr. Mayhew,
I think there ought to be a good chance of
getting the 'Hudson' afloat with plenty of water
under her whole keel. We can even start some
of the engines on shore, and rig winches to haul
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page045">[pg 045]</span><a name="Pg045" id="Pg045" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
on extra cables. Altogether, we can give you a
strong pull, sir.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“That sounds like the best plan to me,”</span>
nodded Jacob Farnum. <span class="tei tei-q">“I'll have a message
sent at once for that towboat.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A white-coated steward now appeared on
deck, moving near the lieutenant commander.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Is dinner ready, Greers?”</span> called Mr. Mayhew.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, sir.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Lay two more plates, then. Mr. Farnum, I
trust you and your young submarine commander
will sit as my guests to-night.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This invitation the yard's owner accepted,
asking only time enough to arrange for keeping
some of his workmen over-time, awaiting the
coming of flood-tide.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So, presently, Jack and his employer found
themselves seated at table in the gunboat's
handsome wardroom. Besides the lieutenant
commander there were Lieutenant Halpin, two
ensigns, two engineer officers and a young medical
officer. In the <span class="tei tei-q">“Hudson's”</span> complement of
officers there were also four midshipmen, but
these latter ate in their own mess.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The time passed most pleasantly, Mr. Mayhew
plainly doing all in his power to atone for
his late censure of the submarine boy.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before dinner was over the small towboat was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page046">[pg 046]</span><a name="Pg046" id="Pg046" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in the harbor. At the coming of flood tide this
towing craft had a hawser made fast to the gunboat.
With the help of some of the naval
machinists aboard the <span class="tei tei-q">“Hudson,”</span> both submarine
craft were also manned and hawsers
made fast. Two cables were passed ashore to
winches to which power was supplied by the
shipyard's engines. When all was ready a
mighty pull was given, the gunboat's own propellers
taking part in the struggle. For two or
three minutes the efforts continued. Then, at
last, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Hudson,”</span> uninjured, ran off into deep
water and shortly afterwards anchored in
safety.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was a moment of tremendous relief for
Mr. Mayhew.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Call the tugboat captain aboard, and I'll
settle with him at my own expense,”</span> proposed
the lieutenant commander.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I trust you will think of nothing of the sort,”</span>
replied Jacob Farnum, quickly. <span class="tei tei-q">“In this harbor
I wish to consider you and your vessel as
my guests.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again Mr. Mayhew expressed his thanks.
Presently, glancing ashore through the night, he
asked:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What sort of country is it hereabouts?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Mostly flat, as to the surface,”</span> Mr. Farnum
replied. <span class="tei tei-q">“If your question goes further, there
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page047">[pg 047]</span><a name="Pg047" id="Pg047" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
are some fine roads and several handsome
estates within a few miles of here. Mr. Mayhew,
won't you and a couple of your officers
come on shore with me? I'll telephone for my
car and put you over quite a few miles this
evening.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Delighted,”</span> replied the commander of the
gunboat.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Hudson's”</span> cutters being now in
the water alongside, the party went ashore in
this. Jack, after bidding the naval officers
good-night, found Hal and Eph, who had just
come ashore from supper on board the <span class="tei tei-q">“Farnum.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No sailing orders yet, I suppose?”</span> Hal
asked.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“None,”</span> Jack replied. <span class="tei tei-q">“I reckon we'll start,
all right, some time to-morrow morning.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What'll we do to-night?”</span> Eph wondered.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I don't know,”</span> replied Jack. <span class="tei tei-q">“We've few
friends around here we need to take the trouble
to say good-bye to. We could call on Mrs. Farnum,
but I imagine we'd run into the naval party
up at the Farnum house. We want to keep a bit
in the background with these naval officers,
except when they may ask for our company.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Let's take a walk about the old town, then,”</span>
Hal suggested.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So the three submarine boys strolled across
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page048">[pg 048]</span><a name="Pg048" id="Pg048" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the shipyard. Just as they were passing
through the gate a man of middle height and
seemingly about thirty years of age quickened
his pace to reach them.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Is this shipyard open nights?”</span> he queried.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Only to some employees,”</span> Jack answered.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I suppose Mr. Farnum isn't about?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Captain Benson?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Benson is my name.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“This letter is addressed to Mr. Farnum,”</span>
went on the stranger, <span class="tei tei-q">“but Mr. Pollard told me
I could hand it to you.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Captain Jack took the letter from the unsealed
envelope.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My dear Farnum,”</span> ran the enclosure,
<span class="tei tei-q">“since you're short a good machinist for the
engine room of the 'Farnum,' the bearer, Samuel
Truax, seems to me to be just the man you
want. I've examined him, and he understands
the sort of machinery we use. Better give him
a chance.”</span> The note was signed in David Pollard's
well-known, scrawly handwriting.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I'm sorry you can't see Mr. Farnum to-night,”</span>
said Benson, pleasantly. <span class="tei tei-q">“He'll be
here early in the morning, though.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“When do you sail?”</span> asked Truax, quickly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“That you would have to ask Mr. Farnum,
too,”</span> smiled Jack.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page049">[pg 049]</span><a name="Pg049" id="Pg049" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“But, see here, Mr. Pollard engaged me to
work aboard one of your submarines.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It looks that way, doesn't it?”</span> laughed the
young skipper.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And you're the captain?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes; but I can't undertake to handle Mr.
Farnum's business for him.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You'll let me go aboard the craft to sleep
for to-night, anyway?”</span> coaxed Truax.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, that's just what I'm not at liberty to
do,”</span> replied the young submarine captain.
<span class="tei tei-q">“No; I couldn't think of that, in the absence
of Mr. Farnum's order.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But that doesn't seem hardly fair,”</span> protested
Truax. <span class="tei tei-q">“See here, I have spent all my
money getting here. I haven't even the price
of a lodging with me, and this isn't a summer
night.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, I'll tell you what I'll do,”</span> Benson
went on, feeling in one of his pockets. <span class="tei tei-q">“Here's
a dollar. That'll buy you a bed and a breakfast
at the hotel up the street. If you want to get
aboard with us in time, you'd better show up
by eight in the morning.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But—”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“That's really all I can do,”</span> Jack Benson
hastily assured the fellow. <span class="tei tei-q">“I'm not the
owner of the boat, and I can't take any liberties.
Oh, wait just a moment. I'll see if there's
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page050">[pg 050]</span><a name="Pg050" id="Pg050" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
any chance of Mr. Farnum coming back to-night.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jack knew well enough that there wasn't any
chance of Mr. Farnum returning, unless possibly
at a very late hour with the naval officers, but
the boy had seen the night watchman peering
out through the gateway.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Retracing his steps, Jack drew the night
watchman inside, whispering:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Just a pointer for you. You've seen that
man on the street with us? He has a letter
from Mr. Pollard to Mr. Farnum, but I wouldn't
let him in the yard to-night, unless Mr. Farnum
appears and gives the order.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I understand,”</span> said the night watchman,
nodding.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“That's all, then, and thank you.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jack Benson hastily rejoined the others on
the sidewalk.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I don't believe, Mr. Truax, it will be worth
your while to come here earlier than eight in
the morning. Better go to the hotel and tie
up to a good sleep. Good night.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Say, why did you take such a dislike to the
fellow?”</span> queried Eph, as the three submarine
boys strolled on up the street, Truax following
slowly at some distance in the rear.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I didn't take a dislike to him,”</span> Jack replied,
opening his eyes wide.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page051">[pg 051]</span><a name="Pg051" id="Pg051" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“You choked him off mighty short, then.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“If it looked that way, then I'm sorry,”</span> Benson
protested, in a tone of genuine regret. <span class="tei tei-q">“All
I wanted to make plain was that I couldn't pass
him on to our precious old boat without Mr.
Farnum's order.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Truax plodded slowly along behind the submarine
boys, a cunning look in the man's eyes
as he stared after Jack Benson.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You're a slick young man, or else a wise
one,”</span> muttered Truax. <span class="tei tei-q">“But I think I'm smart
enough to take it out of you!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nor did Sam Truax go to the hotel. He had
his own plans for this evening—plans that
boded the submarine boys no good.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The three boys strolled easily about town,
getting a hot soda or two, and, finally, drifting
into a moving picture show that had opened
recently in Dunhaven. This place they did not
leave until the show was over. They were half-way
home when Captain Jack remembered that
he had left behind him a book that he had
bought earlier in the evening.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You fellows keep right on down to the yard.
I'll hurry back, get the book and overtake
you,”</span> he proposed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jack ran back, but already the little theatre
was closed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I'm out that book, then, if we sail in the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page052">[pg 052]</span><a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
morning,”</span> he muttered, as he trudged along
after his friends.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the way toward the water front Benson
had to pass a vacant lot surrounded by a high
board fence on a deserted street. He had
passed about half way along the length of the
fence, when a head appeared over the top followed
by a pair of arms holding a small bag
of sand. Down dropped the bag, striking Jack
Benson on the top of the head, sending him unconscious
to the ground.</p>
</div>

<div class="tei tei-div" style="margin-bottom: 5.00em; margin-top: 5.00em">

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Close at hand there was a loose board in
the fence. Through this Sam Truax
thrust his head, peering up and down
the street. Not another soul was in sight.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With a chuckle Truax stepped through the
hole in the fence. Swiftly he gathered up the
young submarine captain, bearing him through
the aperture and dropping him on the ground
behind the fence. At the same time he took
with him the small bag of sand.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Knocked you out, but I don't believe you'll
be unconscious long,”</span> mused Truax, standing
over his young victim, regarding him critically.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page055">[pg 055]</span><a name="Pg055" id="Pg055" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“There wasn't steam enough in the blow to
hurt you for long. You're sturdy, following
the sea all the time, as you do.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With a thoughtful air Sam Truax drew a
small bottle from his pocket, sprinkling some
of the contents over Jack's uniform coat. Immediately
the nauseating smell of liquor rose
on the air.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Now, if someone finds you before you come
to, you'll look like a fellow that has been drinking
and fighting,”</span> muttered Truax under his
breath. <span class="tei tei-q">“If you come to and get back to the
yard without help, you'll walk unsteadily and
have that smell about your clothes. Usually,
it needs only a breath of suspicion to turn folks
against a boy!”</span></p>

<a name="image02" id="image02" class="tei tei-anchor" style="text-align: center"></a><a name="fig12" id="fig12"></a><div class="tei tei-figure" style="text-align: center"><img src="images/image02.jpg" width="390" height="600" alt="Illustration: Down Dropped the Bag." title="Down Dropped the Bag." /><div class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.81em; margin-top: 0.81em"><span style="font-size: 81%">Down Dropped the Bag.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Pausing only long enough to learn that Jack's
pulses were beating, and that the submarine
boy was breathing, Truax stole off into the
night, carrying the bag of sand under his overcoat.
At one point he paused long enough to
empty the sand from the bag over a fence. The
bag itself he afterwards burned in the open fireplace
in the room assigned to him at Holt's
Hotel.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For twenty minutes Jack Benson lay as he
had been left. Then he began to stir, and groan.
Then he opened his eyes; after a while he managed
to sit up.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page056">[pg 056]</span><a name="Pg056" id="Pg056" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Ugh!”</span> he grunted. <span class="tei tei-q">“What's the odor?
Liquor! How does that happen? Oh, my
head!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He got slowly to his feet, using the board
fence as a means to help steady himself. Then,
though he found himself weak and tormented
by the pain in his head, Benson managed to feel
his way along the fence until he came to the
opening made by the loose board. Holding
himself here, he thrust his head beyond.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, Hal and Eph, having waited for some
time at the shore boat, before going out on board
the <span class="tei tei-q">“Farnum,”</span> had at last made up their minds
to go back and look for their missing leader.
They came along just at the moment that the
young captain's head appeared through the
opening in the fence.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“There he is,”</span> muttered Hal, stopping short.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Gracious! He acts queerly. I wonder if
anything can have happened to him? Come
along, Eph!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The two raced across the street.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Jack, old fellow! What on earth's the matter?”</span>
demanded Hal Hastings, anxiously.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I wish you could tell me,”</span> responded Jack
Benson, speaking rather thickly, for he was still
somewhat dazed. <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, my head!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“There has been some queer work here,”</span> muttered
Hal in Eph's ear. <span class="tei tei-q">“Don't torment him
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page057">[pg 057]</span><a name="Pg057" id="Pg057" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with questions. Just help me to get him down
to the yard.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While the two submarine boys were guiding
their weak, dizzy comrade out to the sidewalk
a man came by with a swinging stride. Then
he stopped short, staring in amazement.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Hullo, boys! What on earth has happened?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was Grant Andrews, foreman of the submarine
work at the yard, and a warm personal
friend of Benson's.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I don't believe the old chap feels like telling
us just now,”</span> muttered Hal, with a sour
face.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Whiskey!”</span> muttered Andrews, almost under
his breath. <span class="tei tei-q">“What does it mean? Benson
never touched a drop of that vile stuff, did
he?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“He'd sooner drown himself,”</span> retorted Hal,
with spirit.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Of course he would,”</span> agreed Grant Andrews.
<span class="tei tei-q">“But what is the meaning of all this?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, there's some queer, hocus-pocus business
on foot,”</span> muttered Hal, bitterly. <span class="tei tei-q">“But I
don't believe Jack feels much like telling us
anything about it at present.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In truth, Jack didn't seem inclined to conversation.
He was too sore and dazed to feel
like talking. He couldn't collect his ideas
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page058">[pg 058]</span><a name="Pg058" id="Pg058" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
clearly. The most that he actually knew was
that the pain in his head was tormenting.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I'll pick him right up in my arms and carry
him,”</span> proposed Andrews. <span class="tei tei-q">“I'll take him to
Mr. Farnum's office. Then I'll get a doctor.
We don't want much noise about this, or folks
will be telling all sorts of yarns against Jack
Benson and his drinking habits, when the truth
is he's about the finest, steadiest young fellow
alive!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Just as Andrews was about to carry his purpose
into action, however, an automobile turned
the nearest corner and came swiftly toward
them. In another instant it stopped alongside.
It contained Mr. Farnum and his chauffeur, besides
three naval officers.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What's wrong, Andrews?”</span> called the
yard's owner. <span class="tei tei-q">“Why, that's Jack Benson!
What has happened to him?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hal and Eph stood supporting their comrade,
almost holding him, in fact. Jacob Farnum
leaped from his automobile. Lieutenant
Commander Mayhew followed him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Liquor, eh?”</span> exclaimed the naval officer, the
odor reaching his nostrils.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No such thing,”</span> retorted Farnum, turning
upon the officer. <span class="tei tei-q">“At least, Jack Benson has
been drinking no such stuff.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It was only a guess,”</span> murmured Mr. Mayhew,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page059">[pg 059]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
apologetically. <span class="tei tei-q">“You know your young
man better than I do, Mr. Farnum.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“There is liquor on his clothing,”</span> continued
the shipbuilder. <span class="tei tei-q">“It looks as though someone
had assaulted the lad, laid him out, and then
sprinkled him. It's a wasted trick, though. I
know him too well to be fooled by any such
clumsy bit of nonsense.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“A stupid trick, indeed,”</span> agreed Lieutenant
Commander Mayhew, but the naval officer did
not quite share the shipbuilder's confidence in
the submarine boy's innocence. Mr. Mayhew
had known of too many cases of naval apprentices
ruined through weak indulgence in liquor.
Indeed, he had even known of rare instances in
which cadets had been dismissed from the Naval
Academy for the same offense. The lieutenant
commander's present doubt of Jack Benson was
likely to work to that young man's disadvantage
later on.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Others of the party left the auto. Hal and
Mr. Farnum got into the tonneau, supporting
Jack there between them. Thus they carried
him to Mr. Farnum's office at the yard, Grant
Andrews then going in the car after a doctor,
while the others stretched Jack on the office sofa.
The naval officers returned to the <span class="tei tei-q">“Hudson,”</span> at
anchor in the little harbor below.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The young man acts as though he had been
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page060">[pg 060]</span><a name="Pg060" id="Pg060" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
struck on the head,”</span> was the physician's verdict.
<span class="tei tei-q">“No bones of the skull are broken. The
odor of liquor is on his coat, but I can't seem to
detect any on the breath.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Of course you can't,”</span> commented Jacob
Farnum, crisply. <span class="tei tei-q">“Will Benson be fit to sail in
the morning?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I think so,”</span> nodded the doctor. <span class="tei tei-q">“But there
ought to be a nurse with him to-night.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Take my car, Andrews, and get a man nurse
at once,”</span> directed Mr. Farnum. <span class="tei tei-q">“Doctor, can
the young man be moved to his berth on the
'Farnum'?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Safely enough,”</span> nodded the medical man.
They waited until the nurse arrived, when Jack
was put to bed on the newer submarine craft.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jack slept through the night, moaning once
in a while. Mr. Farnum and the Dunhaven
doctor were aboard early to look at him. The
surgeon from the <span class="tei tei-q">“Hudson”</span> also came over.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Under the effects of medicine Jack Benson
was asleep when, at ten o'clock that morning, the
two submarine torpedo boats slipped their
moorings, following the <span class="tei tei-q">“parent boat,”</span> the
<span class="tei tei-q">“Hudson,”</span> out of the harbor.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ten minutes later the motion of the sea awoke
the young skipper.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Hullo!”</span> muttered the young submarine
skipper, staring curiously
about the little stateroom aft. He
had it to himself, the nurse having been put on
shore. <span class="tei tei-q">“Under way, eh? This is the queerest
start I ever made on a voyage.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nor was it many moments later when Jack
Benson stood on his feet. His clothes were
hung neatly on nails against the wall. One after
another Jack secured the garments, slowly donning
them.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“How my head throbs and buzzes!”</span> he muttered,
his voice sounding unsteady. <span class="tei tei-q">“Gracious!
What could have happened? Let me see. The
last I remember—passing that high fence—”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it was all too great a puzzle. Benson
finally decided to stop guessing until some
future time. He went on with his dressing.
Finally, with his blouse buttoned as exactly as
ever, and his cap placed gingerly on his aching
head, he opened the stateroom door, stepping
out into the cabin.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Accustomed as he was to sea motion, the slight
roll of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Farnum”</span> did not bother the young
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page062">[pg 062]</span><a name="Pg062" id="Pg062" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
skipper much. He soon reached the bottom of
the short spiral stairway leading up into the conning
tower. Up there, in the helmsman's seat,
he espied Hal Hastings with his hands employed
at the steering apparatus. Hal was looking out
over the water, straight ahead.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Sailing these days without word from your
captain, eh?”</span> Jack called, in a voice that carried,
though it shook.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Gracious—you?”</span> ejaculated Hal, looking
down for an instant. Then Hastings pressed a
button connecting with a bell in the engine room.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I'm going up there with you,”</span> Jack volunteered.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Right-o, if you insist,”</span> clicked Eph Somers,
appearing from the engine room and darting to
the young skipper's side. True, Jack's head
swam a bit dizzily as he climbed the stairs, but
Eph's strong support made the task much
easier. There was space to spare on the seat
beside Hal, and into this Jack Benson sank.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Say, you ought to sleep until afternoon,”</span>
was Hastings's next greeting, but Jack was
looking out of the conning tower at the scene
around him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The three craft were leaving the coast directly
behind. About three hundred yards away,
abeam, steamed the <span class="tei tei-q">“Hudson”</span> at a nine-knot
gait.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page063">[pg 063]</span><a name="Pg063" id="Pg063" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“The 'Pollard' is on the other side of the gunboat,
isn't she?”</span> asked Jack.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> Hal nodded.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Naval crew aboard her?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes; Government has taken full possession
of the 'Pollard.'”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Who's running this boat? Just you and
Eph?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No; that new man, Truax, is on board, and
at the last moment Mr. Farnum put Williamson,
one of the machinists, aboard, also. You can
send Williamson back from Annapolis whenever
you're through with him.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Williamson is all right,”</span> nodded Jack,
slowly. <span class="tei tei-q">“But how about Truax?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I think he's going to be a useful man,”</span> Hal
responded. <span class="tei tei-q">“He seems familiar with our type
of engines. Of course, he knows nothing about
the apparatus for submerging the boat or making
it dive. But he doesn't need to. Now,
Jack, old fellow, we're going along all right.
Why not let Eph help you back to your bunk, or
one of the seats in the cabin, and have your sleep
out?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I've had it out,”</span> Benson declared, with a
laugh. <span class="tei tei-q">“I'm ready, now, to take my trick at the
wheel.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Nonsense,”</span> retorted Hal Hastings. <span class="tei tei-q">“I've
been here a bare quarter of an hour, and I'm
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page064">[pg 064]</span><a name="Pg064" id="Pg064" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
good for more work than that. Jack, you're
nothing but a fifth wheel. You're not needed;
won't be all day, and at night we anchor in some
harbor down the coast. Go and rest, like a good
fellow.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Can't rest, when I know I'm doing nothing,”</span>
Benson retorted, stubbornly. <span class="tei tei-q">“Besides, this is
the first time I've ever found myself moving
along in regular formation with the United
States Navy. I feel almost as if I were a Navy
officer myself, and I mean to make the most of
the sensation. Say, Hal, wouldn't it be fine if
we really <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">did</span></span> belong to the Navy?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Gee-whiz!”</span> murmured young Hastings, his
cheeks glowing and his eyes snapping.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“If we only belonged to the old Flag for life,
and knew that we were practising on a boat like
this as a part of the preparation for real war
when it came?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Don't!</span></span>”</span> begged Hal, tensely. <span class="tei tei-q">“For you
know, old fellow, it can't come true. Why, we
haven't even a residence anywhere, from which
a Congressman could appoint one of us to
Annapolis!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">One</span></span> of us?”</span> muttered Jack, scornfully.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Then it would have to be you. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></span> wouldn't go,
even as a cadet at Annapolis, and leave you behind
in just plain, ordinary life, Hal Hastings!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, it's no use thinking about it,”</span> sighed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page065">[pg 065]</span><a name="Pg065" id="Pg065" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Hal, practically. <span class="tei tei-q">“Neither one of us is in any
danger of getting appointed to Annapolis, so
there's no chance that either one of us ever will
become an officer in the Navy. Let's not talk
about it, Jack. I've been contented enough, so
far, but now it makes me almost blue, to think
that we can only go on testing and handling submarine
craft like these, while others will be their
real officers in the Navy, and command them in
any war that may come.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Though his head throbbed, and though a dizzy
spell came over him every few minutes, Jack
Benson stuck it out, up there beside his chum,
for an hour. Then, disdaining aid, he crept
down the stairs, stretching himself out on one of
the cabin seats. Eph brought him a pillow and
a blanket. Jack soon slept, tossing uneasily
whenever pain throbbed dully in his head.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Guess I'll go out and have a little look at the
young captain,”</span> proposed Sam Truax, an hour
later.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Try another guess,”</span> retorted Eph, curtly.
<span class="tei tei-q">“You'll stay here in the engine room. Jack
Benson isn't going to be bothered in any way.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I'm not going to bother him; just going to
take a look at him,”</span> protested Truax, moving
toward the door that separated the engine room
from the cabin.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But young Somers caught the stranger by the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page066">[pg 066]</span><a name="Pg066" id="Pg066" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sleeve of the oily jumper that Sam had donned
on beginning his work.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Do you know what folks say about me?”</span> demanded
Eph, with a significant glare.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What do they say?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Folks have an idea that, at most times, I'm
one of the best-natured fellows on earth,”</span> declared
Eph, solemnly. <span class="tei tei-q">“Yet they <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">do</span></span> say that,
when I'm crossed in anything my mind's made
up to, I can be tarnation ugly. I just told you
I don't want the captain disturbed. Do you
know, Sam Truax, I feel a queer notion coming
over me? I've an idea that that feeling is just
plain ugliness coming to life!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Truax came back from the door, a grin on his
face. Yet, when he turned his head away, there
was a queer, almost deadly flash in the fellow's
eyes.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jack slept, uneasily, until towards the middle
of the afternoon. As soon as Eph found him
awake, that young man brought the captain a
plate of toast and a bowl of broth, both prepared
at the little galley stove.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Sit up and get away with these,”</span> urged Eph,
placing the tray on the cabin table. <span class="tei tei-q">“Wait a
minute. I'll prop you up and put a pillow at
your back.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“This boat isn't a bad place for a fellow
when he's knocked out,”</span> smiled Jack.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page067">[pg 067]</span><a name="Pg067" id="Pg067" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Any place ought to be good, where your
friends are,”</span> came, curtly, from young Somers.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As Captain Jack ate the warm food he felt his
strength coming back to him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Poor old Hal has been up there in the conning
tower all these hours,”</span> muttered Captain
Jack, uneasily. <span class="tei tei-q">“He must have that cramped
feeling in his hands.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Humph!”</span> retorted Eph. <span class="tei tei-q">“Not so you could
notice it much, I guess. It's a simpleton's job
up in the conning tower to-day. All he has to
do is to shift the wheel a little to port, or to starboard,
just so as to keep the proper interval
from the 'Dad' boat. Besides, I've been up
there on relief, for an hour while you slept, and
Hal came down and sat with the engines. Cheer
up, Jack. No one misses you from the conning
tower.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Benson laughed, though he said, warningly:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I reckon we'll do as well to drop calling the
gunboat the 'Dad boat' instead of the 'parent
vessel.'”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, you needn't bother at all about the
conning tower to-day,”</span> wound up Eph, glancing
at his watch. <span class="tei tei-q">“It's after half-past three at this
moment and I understand we're to drop anchor
about five o'clock.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So Skipper Jack settled back with a comfortable
sigh. Truth to tell, it was pleasant not to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page068">[pg 068]</span><a name="Pg068" id="Pg068" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
have any immediate duty, for his head throbbed,
every now and then, and he felt dizzy when he
tried to walk.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Who could have hit me in that fashion, last
night, and for what earthly purpose?”</span> wondered
the boy. <span class="tei tei-q">“I've had some enemies, in the
past, but I don't know a single person about
Dunhaven, now who has any reason for wishing
me harm.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Never a thought crossed his mind of suspecting
Sam Truax. That worthy had come with a
note from David Pollard, the inventor of the
boats. Sam, therefore, must be all right, the
boy reasoned.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jack lay back on the upholstered seat. He
sat with his eyes closed most of the time, though
he did not doze. At last, however, he heard the
engine room bell sound for reduced speed. Getting
up, the young captain made his way to the
foot of the conning tower stairs.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Making port, Hal?”</span> he called.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yep,”</span> came the reply. <span class="tei tei-q">“We'll be at anchor
in five minutes more.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jack made his way slowly to the door of the
engine room.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Eph,”</span> he called, <span class="tei tei-q">“as soon as you've shut
off speed, take Truax above and you two attend
to the mooring.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Take this other man up with you,”</span> urged
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page069">[pg 069]</span><a name="Pg069" id="Pg069" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Sam Truax. <span class="tei tei-q">“I don't know anything about tying
a boat up to moorings.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Time you learned, then,”</span> returned Eph
Somers, <span class="tei tei-q">“if you're to stay aboard a submarine
craft.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Take this other man up with you,”</span> again
urged Truax.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Eph Somers turned around to face him with
a good deal of a glare.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What ails you, Truax? You heard the captain's
order. You'll go with me.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Don't be too sure of that,”</span> uttered Sam
Truax, defiantly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“If you don't go above with me, and if you
don't follow every order you get aboard this
boat, I know where you <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></span> go,”</span> muttered
Eph, decisively.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Where?”</span> jeered Sam.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ashore—in the first boat that can take you
there.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You seem to forget that I'm on board by
David Pollard's order,”</span> sneered Truax.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“All I am sure of,”</span> retorted Eph, <span class="tei tei-q">“is that
Jack Benson is captain on board this craft.
That means that he's sole judge of everything
here when this boat is cruising. If you were
here by the orders of both owners, Jack Benson
would fire you ashore for good, just the
same, after you've balked at the first order.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page070">[pg 070]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Humph! I—”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Clang! Jangle! The signal bell was sounding.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Shut up,”</span> ordered Eph Somers, briskly.
<span class="tei tei-q">“I've got the engine to run on signal from the
watch officer.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There followed a series of signals, first of all
for stopping speed, then for a brief reversing of
engines. A moment later headway speed ahead
was ordered. So on Eph went through the
series of orders until the <span class="tei tei-q">“Farnum”</span> had been
manœuvred to her exact position. Then, from
above, Captain Jack's voice was heard, roaring
in almost his usual tones:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Turn out below, there, to help make fast!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Take the lever, Williamson,”</span> directed Eph.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Come along lively, Truax.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Humph! Let Williamson go,”</span> grumbled
Truax.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You come along with me, my man!”</span> roared
Eph, his face blazing angrily. <span class="tei tei-q">“Hustle, too, or
I'll report you to the captain for disobedience of
orders. Then you'll go ashore at express speed.
Coming?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sam Truax appeared to wage a very brief
battle within himself. Then, nodding sulkily,
he followed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Hustle up, there!”</span> Jack shouted down.
<span class="tei tei-q">“We don't want to drift.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg 071]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Jack Benson stood out on the platform deck,
holding to the conning tower at the port side.
A naval launch had just placed a buoy over an
anchor that had been lowered.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Get forward, you two,”</span> Jack called briskly,
<span class="tei tei-q">“and make the bow cable fast to that buoy.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hal still sat at the wheel in the tower. As
Eph and Truax crept forward over the arched
upper hull of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Farnum,”</span> Hal sounded the
engine room signals and steered until the boat
had gotten close enough to make the bow cable
fast. Then the stern cable was made fast, with
more line, to another buoy.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“A neat hitch, Mr. Benson,”</span> came a voice
from the bridge of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Hudson,”</span> which lay a
short distance away. Jack, looking up, saw
Lieutenant Commander Mayhew leaning over
the bridge rail.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Thank you, sir,”</span> Jack acknowledged, saluting
the naval officer.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The parent vessel and her two submarine
charges now lay at anchor in the harbor at Port
Clovis, one of the towns down the coast from
Dunhaven. This mooring overnight was to be
repeated each day until Annapolis should be
reached.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Within fifteen minutes the craft were surrounded
by small boats from shore. Some of
these contained merchandise that it was hoped
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page072">[pg 072]</span><a name="Pg072" id="Pg072" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sailors would buy. Other boats <span class="tei tei-q">“ran”</span> for
hotels, restaurants, drinking places, amusement
halls, and all the varied places on shore that
hope to fatten on Jack Tar's money.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I'd like to go ashore, sir,”</span> announced Sam
Truax, approaching Captain Jack.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“When?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Now.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“For how long?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Until ten o'clock to-night.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Be back by that hour, then,”</span> Jack replied.
<span class="tei tei-q">“If you're not, you'll find everything shut tight
aboard here.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Truax quickly signaled one of the hovering
boats, and put off in it. Eph watched the boat
for a few moments before he turned to Captain
Jack to mutter:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Somehow, I wouldn't feel very badly about
it if that fellow got lost on shore!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the second day of the cruise Jack
Benson returned to full duty.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For four nights, in all, the submarine
squadron tied up at moorings in harbors
along the coast. On the fifth night, as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page073">[pg 073]</span><a name="Pg073" id="Pg073" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
darkness fell, the squadron continued under
way, in Chesapeake Bay, for Annapolis was but
three hours away.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Immediately after supper Captain Jack took
his place in the conning tower. He concerned
himself principally with the compass, his only
other task being to keep the course by the <span class="tei tei-q">“Hudson's”</span>
lights, for the parent boat supplied in
its own conduct all the navigation orders beyond
the general course. The <span class="tei tei-q">“Farnum's”</span> searchlight
was not used, the gunboat picking up all
the coast-marks as they neared land.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Annapolis is the place I've always wanted to
see,”</span> Jack declared, as Hal joined him in the
conning tower.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It's the place where I've always wanted to
be a cadet,”</span> sighed Hal. <span class="tei tei-q">“But there's no
chance for me, I fear. Jack, I'd rather be an
officer of the Navy than a millionaire.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Same here,”</span> replied Jack, steadily. <span class="tei tei-q">“It's
hard to have to feel that I'll never be either.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As she entered the mouth of the Severn River
the <span class="tei tei-q">“Hudson”</span> signaled to the submarines to
follow, in file, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Pollard”</span> leading. A little
later the three craft entered the Basin at the
Academy. While the gunboat anchored off the
Amphitheatre, the two submarine boats were
ordered to anchorage just off the Boat House.
Then a cutter came alongside.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page074">[pg 074]</span><a name="Pg074" id="Pg074" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“The lieutenant commander's compliments
to Mr. Benson. Will Mr. Benson go aboard the
'Hudson'?”</span> asked the young officer in command
of the cutter. Captain Jack lost no time
in presenting himself before the lieutenant
commander.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Mr. Benson,”</span> said Mr. Mayhew, after greeting
the submarine boy, <span class="tei tei-q">“your craft will be under
a marine guard to-night, and at all times while
here at the Naval Academy. If you and your
crew would like to spend the night ashore, in
the quaint little old town of Annapolis, there's
no reason why you shouldn't. But you will all
need to report back aboard, ready for duty, by
eight in the morning.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jack thanked the naval commander, then hastened
back to the <span class="tei tei-q">“Farnum”</span> to communicate
the news.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Me for the shore trip,”</span> declared Eph,
promptly. All the others agreed with him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I'll come back by ten o'clock to-night,
though,”</span> volunteered Sam Truax. <span class="tei tei-q">“One of the
crew ought to be aboard.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“We'll stay ashore,”</span> decided Jack, <span class="tei tei-q">“and return
in the morning.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I'm coming back to-night,”</span> retorted Truax.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Keep still, and follow orders,”</span> muttered
Eph, digging his elbow into Truax's ribs. <span class="tei tei-q">“The
captain gives the orders here.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page075">[pg 075]</span><a name="Pg075" id="Pg075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Jack, however, had turned away. Within
five minutes a boat put off from shore, bringing
two soldiers of the marine guard alongside.
With them, in the shore boat, was a corporal of
the guard.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Any of your crew coming back to-night,
sir?”</span> asked the corporal.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“None,”</span> Benson answered. <span class="tei tei-q">“Will you instruct
the sentries to see that none of the crew
are allowed aboard during the night?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Very good, sir.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The shore boat waited to convey them to the
landing. Before going, young Captain Benson
closed and locked the manhole entrance to the
conning tower. A sullen silence had fallen over
Truax. The instructions to the corporal of the
guard, and the prompt acceptance of those instructions,
told Sam, beyond any doubt, that he
was <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></span> coming back on board that night.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Truax followed the others as they passed
through the Academy grounds. Beyond the
large, handsome buildings, there was not much
to be seen at night. Lights shone behind all the
windows in Cadet Barracks. Nearly all of the
cadets of the United States Navy were in their
quarters, hard at study. Here and there a
marine sentry paced. A few naval officers, in
uniform, passed along the walks. That was all,
and the submarine party had crossed the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page076">[pg 076]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
grounds to the gate through which they were to
pass into the town of Annapolis.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Coming with us, Truax?”</span> asked Williamson,
as the party passed out into a dimly lighted
street.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No,”</span> replied the fellow, sullenly. <span class="tei tei-q">“I'll
travel by myself.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You're welcome to,”</span> muttered Eph, under
his breath.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The others climbed the steps to the State Capitol
grounds, continuing until they reached one
of the principal streets of the little town.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Say, but this place must have gone to sleep
before we got ashore,”</span> grumbled Eph.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Hanged if I don't think Dunhaven is a livelier
little place!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“There isn't much to do, except to wander
about a bit, then go to the Maryland House for a
good sleep on shore,”</span> Jack admitted.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For more than an hour the submarine boys
wandered about. The principal streets contained
some stores that had a bright, up-to-date
look, and in these principal streets the evening
crowds much resembled those to be found in any
small town. There were other streets, however,
on which there was little traffic. In some of these
quieter streets were quaint, old-fashioned houses
built in the Colonial days.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Annapolis is more of a place to see by daylight,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page077">[pg 077]</span><a name="Pg077" id="Pg077" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
I reckon,”</span> suggested Hal. <span class="tei tei-q">“How about
that sleep, Jack?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The greatest fun, by night, I guess, consists
in finding a drug-store and spending some of our
loose change on ice cream sodas,”</span> laughed the
young submarine skipper.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This done, they found their way to the Maryland
House. Jack and Hal engaged a room together,
Eph and Williamson taking the adjoining
one.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“As for me, in an exciting place like this,”</span>
grimaced Eph, <span class="tei tei-q">“I'm off for bed.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Williamson followed him upstairs. For some
minutes Hal sat with his chum in the hotel office.
Then Jack went over and talked with the night
clerk for a few moments.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“There's a place near here, Hal, where a fellow
can get an oyster fry,”</span> Benson explained,
returning to his chum. <span class="tei tei-q">“With that information
came the discovery that I have an appetite.
Come and join me?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No,”</span> gaped Hal. <span class="tei tei-q">“I reckon I'll go up and
turn in.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I'll be along in half an hour, then.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jack found the oyster house readily. As he
entered the little, not over-clean place, he found
himself the only customer. He gave his order,
then picked up the local daily paper. As he ate,
Jack found himself yawning. The drowsiness
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page078">[pg 078]</span><a name="Pg078" id="Pg078" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of Annapolis by night was coming upon him.
Little did he dream how soon he was to discover
that Annapolis, in some of its parts, can be
lively enough.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As he paid his bill and stepped to the street, a
young mulatto hurried up to him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Am Ah correct, sah, in supposin' yo' Cap'n
Jack Benson?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“That's my name,”</span> Jack admitted.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Den Ah's jes' been 'roun' to de hotel, lookin'
fo' yo', sah. One ob yo' men, Mistah Sam
Truax, am done took sick, an' he done sent me
fo' yo'.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Truax ill? Why, I saw him a couple of
hours ago, and he looked as healthy as a man
could look,”</span> Jack replied, in astonishment.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I reckon, sah, he's mighty po'ly now, sah,”</span>
replied the mulatto. <span class="tei tei-q">“He done gib me money
fo' to hiah a cab an' take yo' to him. Will yo'
please to come, sah?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> agreed Jack. <span class="tei tei-q">“Lead the way.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“T'ank yo', sah; t'ank yo', sah. Follow me,
sah.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jack's mulatto guide led him down the street
a little way, then around a corner. Here a
rickety old cab with a single horse attached,
waited. A gray old darkey sat on the driver's
seat.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Step right inside, sah. We'll be dere
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page079">[pg 079]</span><a name="Pg079" id="Pg079" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
direckly. Marse Truax'll be powahful glad to
see yo', sah.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“See here,”</span> demanded Jack, after they had
driven several blocks at a good speed, <span class="tei tei-q">“Truax
hasn't been getting into any drinking scrapes,
has he? Hasn't been getting himself arrested,
has he?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For young Benson had learned, from the night
clerk at the hotel, that, quiet and <span class="tei tei-q">“dead”</span> as
Annapolis appears to the stranger, there are
<span class="tei tei-q">“tough”</span> places into which a seafaring stranger
may find his way.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No, sah; no, sah,”</span> protested the mulatto.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Marse Truax done got sick right and proper.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, confound it, we're leaving the town
behind,”</span> cried Jack, a few moments later, after
peering out through the cab window.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Dat's all right, sah. Dere ain' nuffin' to be
'fraid ob, sah.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Afraid?”</span> uttered Jack, scornfully, with a
side glance at the mulatto. The submarine boy
felt confident that, in a stretch of trouble, he
could thrash this guide of his in very short
order.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ah might jess well tell yo' wheah we am
gwine, sah,”</span> volunteered the mulatto, presently.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> Benson retorted, drily. <span class="tei tei-q">“I think you
may.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Marse Truax, sah, he done hab er powah ob
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page080">[pg 080]</span><a name="Pg080" id="Pg080" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
trouble, sah, las' wintah, wid rheumatiz, sah.
He 'fraid he gwine cotch it again dis wintah,
sah. Now, sah, dere am some good voodoo
doctahs 'roun' Annapolis, so Marse Truax, he
done gwine to see, sah, what er voodoo can
promise him fo' his rheumatiz. I'se a runnah,
sah, for de smahtest ole voodoo doctah, sah, in
de whole state ob Maryland.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Then you took Truax to a voodoo doctor to-night?”</span>
demanded Jack, almost contemptuously.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, sah; yes, sah.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I thought Truax had more sense than to go
in for such tomfoolery,”</span> Jack Benson retorted,
bluntly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The mulatto launched into a prompt, energetic
defense of the voodoo doctors. Young
Benson had heard a good deal about these clever
old colored frauds. In spite of his contempt,
the submarine boy found himself interested.
He had heard about the charms, spells, incantations
and other humbugs practised on colored
dupes and on some credulous whites by these
greatest of all quacks. The voodoo methods of
<span class="tei tei-q">“healing”</span> are brought out of the deepest jungles
of darkest Africa, yet there are many
ignorant people, even among the whites, who
believe steadfastly in the <span class="tei tei-q">“cures”</span> wrought by
the voodoo.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page081">[pg 081]</span><a name="Pg081" id="Pg081" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
While the mulatto guide was talking, or answering
Jack's half-amused questions, the cab
left Annapolis further and further behind.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yo' see, sah,”</span> the guide went on, <span class="tei tei-q">“Marse
Truax wa'n't in no fit condition, sah, to try de
strongest voodoo medicine dat he called fo'. So,
w'ile de voodoo was sayin' his strongest chahms,
Marse Truax done fall down, frothin' at de
mouth. He am some bettah, now, sah, but he
kain't be move' from de voodoo's house 'cept
by a frien'.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I'll get a chance to see one of these old voodoo
frauds, anyway,”</span> Jack told himself. <span class="tei tei-q">“This
new experience will be worth the time it keeps
me out of my bed. What a pity Hal missed a
queer old treat like this!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the cab at last stopped, Benson looked
out to find that the place was well down a lonely
country road, well lined with trees on either
side. The house, utterly dark from the outside,
was a ramshackle, roomy old affair.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Shall Ah wait fo' yo'?”</span> asked the old colored
driver.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, wait for me,”</span> directed Jack, briefly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yeah; wait fo' de gemmun. He's all right,”</span>
volunteered the mulatto.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Mebbe yo' kin see some voodoo wo'k, too, ef
yo's int'rested,”</span> hinted the guide, in a whisper,
as he fitted a key to a lock, and swung a door
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page082">[pg 082]</span><a name="Pg082" id="Pg082" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
open. In a hallway stood a lighted lantern,
which the guide picked up.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Now, go quiet-lak, on tip-toe. Sh!”</span> cautioned
the guide, himself moving stealthily into
the nearest room. Jack Benson began to feel
secretly awestruck and <span class="tei tei-q">“creepy,”</span> though he
was too full of grit to betray the fact.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the further end of the room the guide,
holding the lantern behind his body as though by
accident, threw open another door.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Pass right on through dis room, ahead ob
me, sah,”</span> begged the guide, respectfully.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But Jack drew back, instinctively, out of the
darkness.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Don' yo', a w'ite man, be 'fraid ob ole voodoo
house,”</span> advised the mulatto, still speaking
respectfully.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Afraid? Of course not. Relying on his muscle
and his agility, Jack stepped ahead. By a
sudden jerk of his arm the mulatto guide shook
out the flame in the lantern.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Here, you! What are you about?”</span> growled
Jack Benson, wheeling like a flash upon his
escort.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Go 'long, yo' w'ite trash!”</span> jeered the
mulatto. He gave the boy a sudden, forceful
shove.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jack Benson, under the impetus of that push,
staggered ahead, seeking to recover his balance.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page083">[pg 083]</span><a name="Pg083" id="Pg083" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Without a doubt he would have done so, but,
just then, the floor under his feet ended. With
a yell of dismay, the submarine boy tottered,
then plunged down, alighting on a bed of soft
dirt many feet below.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Jack Benson was on his feet in an instant.
An angrier boy it would have
been hard to find.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From overhead came the sound of a loud
guffaw.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, you infernal scoundrel!”</span> raged the submarine
boy, shaking his fist in the dark.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“W'at am de matter wid yo', w'ite trash?”</span>
came the jeering query.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Let me get my hands on you, and I'll show
you!”</span> quivered Benson.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yah! Listen to yo'! Yo' wait er minute,
an' Ah'll show yo' a light.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Gr-r-r-r! Gr-r-r-r! That sound from overhead
was not pleasant. Jack, in the few
seconds that were left to him, could only guess
as to the cause of the sounds. Then, some fifteen
feet over his head, a tiny flame sputtered.
This match-end was carried to the wick of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page084">[pg 084]</span><a name="Pg084" id="Pg084" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
lantern that the yellowish guide had been carrying,
and now the light illumined the place into
which Jack Benson had fallen.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That place was a square-shaped pit, with
boarded sides. Up above, on a shelf of flooring,
knelt the late guide, grinning down with a
look of infernal glee. On either side of the
mulatto stood a heavy-jowled bull-dog. Both
brutes peered down, showing their teeth in a
way to make a timid man's blood run cold.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Put those dogs back and come down here,”</span>
challenged Jack, shaking his fist. <span class="tei tei-q">“Come down,
and I'll teach you a few things, you rascal!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Don' yo' shake yo' fist at me, or dem dawgs
will sure jump down and tackle yo',”</span> grinned
the guide, gripping at the collars of the brutes,
which, truly, showed signs of intending to spring
below.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jack fell back, his hands dropping to his sides.
Had there been but one dog, the submarine boy,
with all his grit forced to the surface, might
have chosen to face the brute, hoping to despatch
it with a well-aimed kick. But with two dogs,
both intent on <span class="tei tei-q">“getting”</span> him, young Benson
knew that he would stand the fabled chance of
a snow-flake on a red-hot stove.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Dat's right, gemmun, yo' keep cool,”</span> observed
the mulatto, mockingly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You've decoyed me—trapped me here with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page085">[pg 085]</span><a name="Pg085" id="Pg085" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a mess of lies,”</span> flung back Captain Jack,
angrily. <span class="tei tei-q">“What's your game?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Dis am a free lodgin' house—ho, ho, ho!”</span>
chuckled the late guide. <span class="tei tei-q">“Ah's gwine gib yo'
er place to sleep fo' de night. Yo' sho'ly must
feel 'bleeged to me—ho, ho, ho!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You lied to me about Sam Truax!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yeah! Ah done foun' dat was de name ob a

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mulatto and light vanished, but enraged,
baffled, helpless Captain Jack could hear the
two dogs moving about ere they settled down on
the shelf of flooring overhead.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No matter how much of a liar that rascal is,
he didn't lie to me about the dogs,”</span> reflected
Jack, his temper cooling, but his bitterness increasing.
<span class="tei tei-q">“They're fighting dogs, and one
wrong move would bring them bounding down
here on me—the two together. Ugh-gh!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page086">[pg 086]</span><a name="Pg086" id="Pg086" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
After a few moments the mulatto reappeared
with a light and tossed down three heavy
blankets.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Now, Ah's gwine leave yo' fo' de night,”</span>
clacked the late guide. <span class="tei tei-q">“Ef yo' done feel lonesome,
yo' jes' whistle de dawgs down to yo'.
Dey'll come!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While the light was still there Benson, in raging
silence, gathered the blankets and arranged
them.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Roll up one fo' a pillow, under yo' haid,”</span>
grinned the mulatto. <span class="tei tei-q">“Dat's all right, sah.
Now, good night, Marse Benson. Ef yo' feel
lonesome, Marse Benson, jes' whistle fo' de
dawgs. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dey'll come!</span></span>”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The light vanished while the mulatto's sinister
words were ringing in the boy's ears. Would
the dogs jump down? Jack knew they would,
at the first false move or sound on his part. He
huddled softly, stealthily, on the blankets, there
in the darkness.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As he lay there, thinking, Benson's sense of
admiration gradually got to the surface.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, of all the slick man-traps!”</span> he gasped.
<span class="tei tei-q">“I never heard of anything more clever. Nor
was there ever a bigger idiot than I, to walk
stupidly into this same trap! What's the game,
I wonder? Robbery, it must be. And I have a
watch, some other little valuables and nearly a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page087">[pg 087]</span><a name="Pg087" id="Pg087" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
hundred and fifty dollars in money on me. Oh,
I'm the sleek, fat goose for plucking!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lying there, in enforced stillness, Jack Benson,
after an hour or so, actually fell asleep. A
good, healthy sleeper at all times, he slumbered
on through the night. Once he awoke, just a
trifle chilled. He heard one of the dogs snoring
overhead. Crawling under one of the blankets,
Benson went to sleep again.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Hey, yo', Marse Benson. It am mawnin'.
Time yo' was wakin' up an' movin' erlong!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was the voice of the same mulatto, calling
down into the pit. Again the rays of the lantern
illumined the darkness. Both bull-dogs
displayed their ferocious muzzles over the edge
of the pit. Jack sat up cautiously, not caring to
attract unfriendly interest from the dogs.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ah want yo' to take off all yo' clothes 'cept
yo' undahclothes, an' den Ah'll let down a string
fo' yo' to tie 'em to,”</span> declared the mulatto,
grinning. <span class="tei tei-q">“Yo' needn't try ter slip yo' wallet,
nor nuffin' outer mah sight, cause Ah'll be
watchin'. Now, git a hurry on, Marse Benson,
or Ah'll done push dem dawgs ober de aidge
ob dis flooring.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jack hesitated only a moment. Then, with a
grunt of rage, he began removing his outer garments.
Down came a twine, to the lower end of
which the boy made fast his garments, one after
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page088">[pg 088]</span><a name="Pg088" id="Pg088" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
another. His money and valuables went up in
the pockets, for the sharp eyes of the mulatto
could not have been eluded by any amateur
slight-of-hand.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Now, yo' cap an' yo' shoes,”</span> directed the
grinning monster above.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These, too, Benson passed up at the end of the
cord. The mulatto disappeared, leaving the
two dogs still on guard. At last, back came the
light and the yellowish man with it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yo' sho' is good picking, Marse Benson,”</span>
grinned the guide of the night before. <span class="tei tei-q">“Yo'
has good pin feathers. Ah hope Ah'll suttinly
meet yo' again.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I hope we do meet at another time!”</span> Jack
Benson flared back, wrathily. The cool insolence
of the fellow cut him to the marrow, yet
where was the use of disobeying a rascal flanked
by two such willing and capable dogs?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Now, yo' jes' put dese t'ings on, Marse Benson,
ef yo' please, sah,”</span> mocked the mulatto,
tossing down some woefully tattered, nondescript
garments, and, after them, a battered,
rimless Derby hat and a pair of brogans out at
the toes.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I'll be hanged if I'll put on such duds!”</span>
quivered Jack.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Jes' as yo' please, ob co'se, Marse Benson,”</span>
came the answer, from above. <span class="tei tei-q">“But, ef yo'
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page089">[pg 089]</span><a name="Pg089" id="Pg089" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
don' put dem t'ings on, yo'll sho'ly hab ter
gwine back ter 'Napolis in yo' undahclo's.
An' yo's gwine back right away, too, so, ef yo'
wants ter gwine back weahin' ernuff clo'es—”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, well, then—!”</span> ground out the submarine
boy, savagely enough.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He attired himself in these tattered ends of
raiment. Had he not been so angry he must
have roared at sight of his comical self when the
dressing was completed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Now, yo'll do, Ah reckons.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With that, the mulatto guide of the
night before threw down one end of
an inch rope.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ah reckon yo's sailor ernuff to clim' dat.
Come right erlong, 'less yo' wants de dawgs ter

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But they'll tackle me if I come up,”</span> objected
Jack Benson.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No, dey won't. Dem dawgs is train' to dis
wo'k. Ah done tole yo' dat. Come right
erlong. Ah'll keep my two eyes on dem

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It looked like a highly risky bit of business,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page090">[pg 090]</span><a name="Pg090" id="Pg090" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
but Jack told himself that, now he had been deprived
of his valuables, this yellow worthy must
be genuinely anxious to be rid of the victim. So
he took hold of the rope and began to climb.
The mulatto and the dogs disappeared from the
upper edge of the pit.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As his head came up above the level of the
flooring Benson saw the mulatto and the dogs
in the next room, the connecting door of which
had been taken from its hinges.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Come right in, Marse Benson. Dere ain'
nuffin' gwineter hu't yo',”</span> came the rascal's
voice reassuringly. Jack obeyed by stepping
into the next room, though he kept watch over
the dogs out of the corners of his eyes.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Now, yo' lie right down on de flo', Marse
Benson,”</span> commanded the master of the situation.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Ah's gotter tie yo' up, befo' Ah can
staht yo' back ter 'Napolis, but dere ain' no
hahm gwine come ter yo'.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Making a virtue of necessity, Captain Jack
lay down as directed, passing his hands behind
his back. These were deftly secured, after
which his ankles were treated in the same
fashion. Immediately the mulatto, who was
strong and wiry, lifted the boy and the lantern
together. The dogs remaining behind, Jack
was carried out into the yard, where he discovered
that daylight was coming on in the East.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page091">[pg 091]</span><a name="Pg091" id="Pg091" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
He was dumped on the ground long enough to
permit his captor to lock the door securely.
Then the submarine boy was lifted once more,
carried around the corner of the house and
dumped in the bottom of a shabby old delivery
wagon. A canvas was pulled over him, concealing
him from any chance passer. Then the
mulatto ran around to the seat, picking up the
reins and starting the horse.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It seemed like a long drive to the boy, though
Benson was certainly in no position to judge
time accurately. At last the team was halted,
along a stretch of road in a deep woods. The
mulatto lifted the submarine boy out to the
ground.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Now, w'en yo's got yo' se'f free, yo' can
take de road in dat direckshun,”</span> declared the
fellow, pointing. <span class="tei tei-q">“Bimeby yo' come in sight ob
de town. Now, Marse Benson, w'at happen to
yo' las' night am all in de co'se ob a lifetime, an'
Ah hope you ain't got no bad feelin's. Yo' suttinly
done learn somet'ing new in de way ob
tricks. Good-bye, sah, an' mah compliments to
yo', Marse Benson.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With that the guide of the night before swiftly
cut the cords at Jack's wrists, then as swiftly
leaped to the seat of the wagon, whipping up the
horse and disappearing in a cloud of dust.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jack, having now no knife, and the bonds
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg 092]</span><a name="Pg092" id="Pg092" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
about his ankles being tied with many hard
knots, spent some precious minutes in freeing
his feet. At last he stood up, fire in his eyes.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, pshaw! There's no sense in trying to
run after that rascal and his wagon,”</span> decided
the young submarine skipper. <span class="tei tei-q">“I haven't the
slightest idea what direction he took after he
got out of sight, and—oh, gracious! I'm under
orders to be aboard the 'Farnum' at eight this
morning. And on Mr. Farnum's business, at
that!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Clenching his hands vengefully, Jack started
along in the direction pointed out by his late
captor. Brisk walking wore some of the edge
off his great wrath. Catching a comprehensive
glimpse of himself, Jack could not keep back a
grim laugh.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, I certainly am a dandy to spring myself
on the trim and slick Naval Academy!”</span> he
gritted. <span class="tei tei-q">“What a treat I'll be to the cadets!
That is, if the sentry ever lets me through the
gate into the Academy grounds.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As he hurried along, Jack Benson decided
that he simply could not go to the Naval
Academy presenting any such grotesque picture
as he did now. Yet he had no money about him
with which to purchase more presentable clothes
in town. So he formed another plan.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Within a few minutes he came in sight of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page093">[pg 093]</span><a name="Pg093" id="Pg093" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Annapolis. Hurrying on faster, he at last entered
the town. The further he went the more
painfully conscious the boy became of the
ludicrous appearance that he made. He saw
men and women turn their heads to look after
him, and his cheeks burned to a deep scarlet that
glowed over the sea-bronze of his skin.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The single consolation I have is that not a
solitary person in town knows me, anyway,”</span>
he muttered. Then he caught sight of a clock
on a church steeple—twenty-five minutes of
eight.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“That means a fearful hustle,”</span> he muttered,
and went ahead under such steam that he all but
panted. At last he came to the Maryland
House, opposite the State Capitol grounds.
Into the office of the hotel he darted, going
straight up to the desk.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A clerk who had been on duty for hours, and
who was growing more drowsy every moment,
stared at the boy in amazement.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“See here, you ragamuffin, what—”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My name is Benson,”</span> began the boy, breathlessly.
<span class="tei tei-q">“I'm a guest of the house—arrived last
night. I—”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You, a guest of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></span> house?”</span> demanded the
clerk of the most select hotel in the town.
<span class="tei tei-q">“You—”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That was as far as the disgust of the clerk
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page094">[pg 094]</span><a name="Pg094" id="Pg094" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
would permit him to go in words. A score of
well-dressed gentlemen were staring in astonishment
at the scene. The clerk nodded to two
stout porters who had suspended their work
nearby.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It had been Jack Benson's purpose to go to
his room and keep out of sight, while despatching
one of the colored bell-boys of the hotel with
a note to Hal Hastings, asking that chum to send
him up a uniform and other articles of attire.
However, before the young submarine captain
fully realized what was happening, the two porters
had seized him. Firmly, even though
gently, they hustled him out through the entrance
onto the street.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Scat!”</span> advised one of the pair.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jack started to protest, then realized the
hopelessness of such a course. In truth, he did
not blame the hotel folks in the least.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, well,”</span> he sighed, paling as soon as the
new flush of mortification had died out, <span class="tei tei-q">“there's
nothing for it but to hurry to the Academy. I
hope the sentries won't shoot when they see
me,”</span> he added, bitterly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Across the State Capitol grounds he hurried,
then down through a side street until he arrived
at the gate of the Academy grounds.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Halt!”</span> challenged a sentry, as soon as Jack
showed his face through the gateway.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page095">[pg 095]</span><a name="Pg095" id="Pg095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Young Benson stopped, bringing his heels together
with a click.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What do you want? Where are you going?”</span>
demanded the marine.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I know I look pretty tough,”</span> Jack admitted,
shamefacedly. <span class="tei tei-q">“But I belong aboard the 'Farnum,'
one of the submarines that arrived last
night. And I'm due there at this minute.
Please don't delay me.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“All right,”</span> replied the sentry, after surveying
the boy from head to foot once more. Then
he added, in a lower tone, with just the suspicion
of a grin showing at the corners of his mouth:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Say, friend, for a stranger, you must have
had a high old frolic in the town last night.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jack frowned. The sentry's grin broadened
a bit. As he did not offer to detain the boy
longer, Benson hurried on along one of the
walks. He took as short a course as he could
making straight for the Basin, where he made
out the <span class="tei tei-q">“Hudson”</span> and the two submarines.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Hey! There's the captain!”</span> shouted Eph,
wonderingly, for Somers's eyes were sharp at
all times.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Out of the conning tower sprang Hal Hastings,
looking eagerly in the direction in which
Eph Somers pointed:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Eh?”</span> muttered another person, lounging
near the rail of the gunboat. Then Lieutenant
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page096">[pg 096]</span><a name="Pg096" id="Pg096" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Commander Mayhew, after a keen, wholly disapproving
look at the hard-looking figure of a
young man at the landing, started, as he muttered:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Benson, by all that's horrible! How did he
come to be in that fearful shape? He must have
been in one of the worst resorts within miles of
Annapolis!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“This isn't the first time the young man has
come back the worse for wear,”</span> the lieutenant
commander continued, under his breath. <span class="tei tei-q">“His
friends were loyal enough to him, that time. I
wonder if they can be, to-day?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the shore boats, waiting about in the
Basin, put young Benson aboard the <span class="tei tei-q">“Farnum”</span>
as soon as he explained who he was. Hal
and Eph stood awaiting the coming of their
young commander, their faces full of concern
and anxiety. Both gripped Jack's hand as soon
as he gained the platform deck of the submarine.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Come below,”</span> whispered Hal. <span class="tei tei-q">“We'll talk
there. You need a bath and to get into a uniform
as quickly as you can.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This need Jack Benson proceeded to realize
without an instant's delay. While he washed
himself off, in one of the staterooms aft, he
talked through the door, which had been left
ajar. He continued his story while he dressed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page097">[pg 097]</span><a name="Pg097" id="Pg097" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“We were fearfully anxious this morning,”</span>
Hal confessed. <span class="tei tei-q">“I went to sleep last night, and
didn't know of your absence until this morning.
Then Eph and I decided to come on down to the
boat to see if you were here. We were just
planning to send quiet word to the Annapolis
police when Eph spotted you coming.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And Truax?”</span> inquired Captain Jack.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“He and Williamson are forward in the
engine-room, now, at breakfast.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, well, Truax wouldn't know anything
about the scrape, anyway,”</span> returned Jack.
<span class="tei tei-q">“His name was learned and used—that's all.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Are you going to try to find that place, catch
the mulatto and force the return of your
money?”</span> demanded Eph Somers.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I've got to think that over,”</span> muttered Jack,
as he drew on a spick-and-span uniform blouse.
<span class="tei tei-q">“I don't know whether there'll be any use in
trying to find that mulatto. I haven't the least
idea where his place is. Even if I found it, it's
ten to one I wouldn't find the fellow there.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“'Farnum,' ahoy!”</span> roared a voice alongside,
the voice coming down through the open conning
tower.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Eph ran to answer. When he returned, he
announced:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Compliments of Lieutenant Commander
Mayhew, and will Mr. Benson wait on the lieutenant
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page098">[pg 098]</span><a name="Pg098" id="Pg098" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
commander on board the parent boat?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I will,”</span> assented Jack, with a wry face, <span class="tei tei-q">“and
here's where I have to do some tall but truthful
explaining to a man who isn't in the least likely
to believe a word I say. I can guess what Mr.
Mayhew is thinking, and is going to keep on
thinking!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jack Benson looked as natty as a young man
could look, and his uniform was that of a naval
officer, save for the absence of the insignia of
rank.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Up the side gangway of the gunboat Jack
mounted, carrying himself in the best naval
style. On deck stood a sentry, an orderly waiting
beside him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Lieutenant Commander Mayhew will see
you in his cabin, sir,”</span> announced the orderly.
<span class="tei tei-q">“I will show you the way, sir.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Mayhew was seated before a desk in his
cabin when the orderly piloted the submarine
boy in. The naval officer did not rise, nor did
he ask the boy to take a seat. Jack Benson was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page099">[pg 099]</span><a name="Pg099" id="Pg099" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
very well aware that he stood in Mr. Mayhew's
presence in the light of a culprit.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Mr. Benson,”</span> began Mr. Mayhew, eyeing
him closely, <span class="tei tei-q">“you are not in the naval service,
and are not therefore amenable to its discipline.
At the same time, however, your employers have
furnished you to act, in some respects, as a civilian
instructor in submarine boating before the
cadets. While you are here on that duty it is
to be expected, therefore, that you will conform
generally to the rules of conduct as laid down at
the Naval Academy.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, sir,”</span> replied Jack.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“As I am at present in charge of the submarine
purchased by the United States from
your company, and at least in nominal charge
of the 'Farnum,' as well, I am, in a measure,
to be looked upon, for the present, as your commanding
officer.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, sir,”</span> assented the boy.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You came aboard your craft, this morning,
in a very questionable looking condition.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, sir.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jack Benson's composure was perfect. His
sense of discipline was also exact. He did not
propose to offer any explanations until such
were asked of him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Have you anything to say, Mr. Benson, as
to that condition, and how you came to be in it?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a name="Pg100" id="Pg100" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Shall I explain it to you, sir?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I shall be glad to hear your explanation.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thereupon, the submarine boy plunged into
a concise description of what had happened to
him the night before. The lieutenant commander
did not once interrupt him, but, when
Jack had finished, Mr. Mayhew observed:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“That is a very remarkable story, Mr. Benson.
Most remarkable.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, sir, it is. May I ask if you doubt my
story?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jack looked straight into the officer's eyes as
he put the question bluntly. An officer of the
Army or of the Navy <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">must not</span></span> answer a question
untruthfully. Neither, as a rule, may he
make an evasive answer. So the lieutenant
commander thought a moment, before he replied:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I don't feel that I know you well enough,
Mr. Benson, to express an opinion that might be
wholly fair to you. The most I can say, now,
is that I very sincerely hope such a thing will
not happen again during your stay at the Naval
Academy.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It won't, sir,”</span> promised Jack Benson, <span class="tei tei-q">“if I
have hereafter the amount of good judgment
that I ought to be expected to possess.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I hope not, Mr. Benson, for it would destroy
your usefulness here. A civilian instructor
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
here, as much as a naval instructor, must possess
the whole confidence and respect of the
cadet battalion. I hope none of the cadets who
may have seen you this morning recognized
you.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then, taking on a different tone, Mr. Mayhew
informed his young listener that a section of
cadets would board the <span class="tei tei-q">“Farnum”</span> at eleven
that morning, another section at three in the
afternoon, and a third at four o'clock.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Of course you will have everything aboard
your craft wholly shipshape, Mr. Benson, and I
trust I hardly need add that, in the Navy, we
are punctual to the minute.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You will find me punctual to the minute
before, sir.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Very good, Mr. Benson. That is all. You
may go.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jack saluted, then turned away, finding his
way to the deck. The cutter was still alongside,
and conveyed him back to the <span class="tei tei-q">“Farnum.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Mr. Mayhew demanded your story, of
course?”</span> propounded Hal Hastings. <span class="tei tei-q">“What
did he think?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“He didn't say so,”</span> replied Jack Benson,
with a wry smile, <span class="tei tei-q">“but he let me see that he
thought I was out of my element on a submarine
boat.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“How so?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Why, it is very plain that Mr. Mayhew
thinks I ought to employ my time writing improbable
fiction.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, Mayhew be bothered!”</span> exploded Eph.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Hardly,”</span> retorted Jack. <span class="tei tei-q">“Mr. Mayhew is
an officer and a gentleman. I admit that my
yarn <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">does</span></span> sound fishy to a stranger. Besides,
fellows, Mr. Mayhew represents the naval officers
through whose good opinion our employers
hope to sell a big fleet of submarine torpedo
boats to the United States Government.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Then what are you going to do about it?”</span>
asked Hal, as the three boys reached the cabin
below.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“First of all, I'm going to rummage about and
get myself some breakfast.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“If you do, there'll be a fight,”</span> growled Eph
Somers. <span class="tei tei-q">“I'll hash up a breakfast for you.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And, afterwards?”</span> persisted Hal.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I'm going to try to win Mr. Mayhew's good
opinion, and that of every other naval officer or
cadet I may happen to meet.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why the cadets, particularly?”</span> asked Eph
Somers.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Because, for one business reason, the cadets
are going to be the naval officers of to-morrow,
and the Pollard Submarine Boat Company
hopes to be building craft for the Navy for a
good many years to come.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span><a name="Pg103" id="Pg103" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Good enough!”</span> nodded Hal, while Eph
dodged away to get that breakfast ready.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sam Truax lounged back in the engine room,
smoking a short pipe. With him stuck Williamson,
for Eph had privately instructed the
machinist from the Farnum yard not to leave
the stranger alone in the engine room.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why don't you go up on deck and get a few
whiffs of fresh air?”</span> asked Truax.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, I'm comfortable down here,”</span> grunted
the machinist, who was stretched out on one of
the leather-cushioned seats that ran along the
side of the engine room.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I should think you'd want to get out of here
once in a while, though,”</span> returned Truax.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why?”</span> asked the machinist. <span class="tei tei-q">“Anything
you want to be left alone here for?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, of course not,”</span> drawled Truax, blowing
out a cloud of tobacco smoke.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Then I guess I'll stay where I am,”</span> nodded
Williamson.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Sorry, but you'll have to stop all smoking in
here now,”</span> announced Eph, thrusting his head
in at the doorway. <span class="tei tei-q">“There'll be a lot of cadets
aboard at eleven o'clock, and we want the air
clear and sweet. You'd better go all over the
machinery and see that everything is in applepie
order and appearance. Mr. Hastings will
be in here soon to inspect it.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg 104]</span><a name="Pg104" id="Pg104" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Just what rank does <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></span> young turkey-cock
hold on board?”</span> sneered Truax, when the door
had closed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Don't know, I'm sure,”</span> replied Williamson.
<span class="tei tei-q">“All I know is that the three youngsters are
aboard here to run the boat and show it off to
the best advantage. My pay is running right
along, and I've no kick at taking orders from
any one of them.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“This is where I go on smoking, anyway,”</span>
declared Truax, insolently, striking a match and
lighting his pipe again. Williamson reached
over, snatching the pipe from between the other
man's teeth and dumping out the coals, after
which the machinist coolly dropped the pipe into
one of his own pockets.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“If you go on this way,”</span> warned Williamson,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Captain Benson will get it into his head to put
you on shore in a jiffy, and for good.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I'd like to see him try it,”</span> sneered Sam
Truax.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You'll get your wish, if you go on the way
you've been going!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Humph! I don't believe the Benson boy
carries the size or the weight to put me ashore.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“He doesn't need any size or weight,”</span> retorted
Williamson, crisply. <span class="tei tei-q">“If Captain Benson
wants you off this boat, it's only the matter
of a moment for him to get a squad of marines
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg 105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
on board—and you'll march off to the 'Rogues'
March.'”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“So that's the way he'd work it, eh?”</span> demanded
Sam Truax, turning green and ugly
around the lips.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You bet it is,”</span> retorted the machinist.
<span class="tei tei-q">“We're practically a part of the United States
Navy for these few days, and naval rules will
govern any game we may get into.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On that hint things went along better in the
engine room. When Hal Hastings came in to
inspect he found nothing to criticise.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the minute of eleven o'clock a squad of
some twenty cadets came marching down to the
landing in front of the boat house. There Lieutenant
Commander Mayhew and one of his
engineer officers met them. Two cutters manned
by sailors brought the party out alongside,
where Jack and Hal stood ready to receive them.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A very natty looking squad of future admirals
came aboard, grouping themselves about on the
platform deck. It was rather a tight squeeze
for so many human beings in that space.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After greeting the submarine boys, Mr. Mayhew
turned to the cadets, calling their attention
to the lines and outer construction of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Farnum.”</span>
Then he turned to the three submarine
boys, signing to them to crowd forward.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“These young gentlemen,”</span> announced the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg 106]</span><a name="Pg106" id="Pg106" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
lieutenant commander, <span class="tei tei-q">“are Mr. Benson, Mr.
Hastings and Mr. Somers. All three are thoroughly
familiar with the Pollard type of boat.
As the Navy has purchased one Pollard boat,
and may acquire others, it is well that you
cadets should understand all the working details
of the Pollard Submarine Company's crafts. A
few of you at a time will now step into the conning
tower, and Mr. Benson will explain to you
the steering and control gear used there.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Half a dozen of the cadets managed to squeeze
into the conning tower. Jack experienced an
odd feeling, half of embarrassment, as he explained
before so many attentive pairs of eyes.
Then another squad of cadets took the place of
the first on-lookers. After a while all had been
instructed in the use of the conning tower
appliances.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Mr. Benson,”</span> continued the lieutenant commander,
<span class="tei tei-q">“will now lead the way for all hands to
the cabin. There he will explain the uses of the
diving controls, the compressed air apparatus,
and other details usually worked from the
cabin.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Down below came the cadets, in orderly fashion,
without either haste or lagging. Having
warmed up to his subject, Jack Benson lectured
earnestly, even if not with fine skill. At last he
paused.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span><a name="Pg107" id="Pg107" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Any of the cadets may now ask questions,”</span>
announced Lieutenant Commander Mayhew.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was a pause, then one of the older
cadets turned to Jack to ask:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What volume of compressed air do you
carry at your full capacity?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Mr. Benson's present status,”</span> rapped Mr.
Mayhew, quickly, <span class="tei tei-q">“is that of a civilian instructor.
Any cadet who addresses Mr. Benson will
therefore say 'sir,' in all cases, just as in addressing
an officer of the Navy.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The cadet so corrected, who was at least
twenty-one years old, flushed as he glanced
swiftly at sixteen-year-old Jack. To say <span class="tei tei-q">“sir”</span>
to such a youngster seemed almost like a
humiliation. Yet the cadet repeated his question,
adding the <span class="tei tei-q">“sir.”</span> Jack quickly answered
the question. Then two or three other questions
were asked by other cadets. It was plain,
however, that to all of the cadets the use of
<span class="tei tei-q">“sir”</span> to so young a boy appealed, at least, to
their sense of humor.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Through the engine room door Sam Truax
and Williamson stood taking it all in. Sam saw
a flash in the eye of one big cadet when the question
of <span class="tei tei-q">“sir”</span> came up.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Presently the squad filed into the engine room.
Here Hal Hastings had the floor for instruction.
He did his work coolly, admirably, though he
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span><a name="Pg108" id="Pg108" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
asked Jack Benson to explain a few of the
points.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then the questions began, directed at Hal.
This time none of the cadets, under the watchful
eyes of Mr. Mayhew, forgot to say <span class="tei tei-q">“sir”</span> when
speaking to Hastings.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sam Truax edged up behind the big cadet
whose eyes he had seen flash a few moments
before.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Go after Benson, good and hard,”</span> whispered
Truax.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The cadet looked keenly at Truax.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You can have a lot of fun with Benson,”</span>
whispered Truax, <span class="tei tei-q">“if you fire a lot of questions
at him, hard and fast. Benson is a conceited fellow,
who knows a few things about the boat, but
you can get him rattled and red-faced in no
time.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The big cadet wheeled upon Jack.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Mr. Benson, how long have you been
engaged on submarine boats, sir?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Since July,”</span> Jack replied.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“July of this year?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And it is now October. Do you consider
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page109">[pg 109]</span><a name="Pg109" id="Pg109" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that enough time, sir, in which to learn much
about submarine boats?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“That depends,”</span> Skipper Jack replied,
<span class="tei tei-q">“upon a man's ability in such a subject.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Is it long enough time, sir, for a boy?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That was rather a hard dig. Instantly the
other cadets became all attention.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It depends upon the boy, as it would upon
the man,”</span> Jack answered.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Do you consider, Mr. Benson, that you know
all about submarine boats, sir?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, no.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Who does, sir?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No one that I ever heard of,”</span> Jack answered.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Few men interested in submarine
boats know much beyond the peculiarities of
their own boats.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And that applies equally to boys, sir?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> Jack smiled.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Do you consider yourself, sir, fully competent
to handle this craft?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I'd rather someone else would say it,”</span> Jack
replied. <span class="tei tei-q">“My employers, though, seem to consider
me competent.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What is this material, sir?”</span> continued the
cadet, resting a hand on a piston rod.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Brass,”</span> Benson replied, promptly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Do you know the specific gravity and the
tensile strength of this brass?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span><a name="Pg110" id="Pg110" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Before Jack could answer Mr. Mayhew broke
in, crisply:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“That will do, Mr. Merriam. Your questions
appear to go beyond the limits of ordinary instruction,
and to partake more of the nature of
a cross-examination. Such questions take up
the time of the instruction tour unnecessarily.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cadet Merriam flushed slightly, as he saluted
the naval officer. Then the cadet's jaws settled
squarely. He remained silent.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A few more questions and the hour was up.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lieutenant Commander Mayhew gave the
order for the cadets to pass above and embark
in the cutters. He remained behind long
enough to say to the three submarine boys:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You have done splendidly, gentlemen—far
better than I expected you to do. If you manage
the sea instruction as well, in the days to
come, our cadets will have a first-class idea of
the handling of the Pollard boats.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I wish, sir,”</span> Jack replied, after thanking the
officer, <span class="tei tei-q">“that the cadets were not required to say
'sir' to us. It sounds odd, and I am quite certain
that none of the young men like it.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It is necessary, though,”</span> replied Mr. Mayhew.
<span class="tei tei-q">“They are required to do it with all
civilian instructors, and it would never do to
draw distinctions on account of age. Yes; it is
necessary.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg 111]</span><a name="Pg111" id="Pg111" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
When the second squad of cadets arrived, in
the afternoon, the three submarine boys found
themselves ready for their task without misgivings.
Eph took more part in the explanations
than he had done in the forenoon. Then came a
third squad of cadets, to be taken over the same
ground. The young men of both these squads
used the <span class="tei tei-q">“sir”</span> at once, having been previously
warned by one of the naval officers.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“That will be all for to-day, Mr. Benson, and
thank you and your friends for some excellent
work,”</span> said Lieutenant Commander Mayhew,
when the third squad had filed away.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Say, for hard work I'd like this job right
along,”</span> yawned Eph Somers, when the three
were alone in the cabin. <span class="tei tei-q">“Just talking three
times a day—what an easy way of living!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It's all right for a while,”</span> agreed Jack.
<span class="tei tei-q">“But it would grow tiresome after a few weeks,
anyway. Lying here in the Basin, and talking
like a salesman once in a while, isn't like a life
of adventure.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, you can sigh for adventure, if you
wish,”</span> yawned Eph. <span class="tei tei-q">“As for me, I've had
enough hard work to appreciate a rest once in a
while. Going into the town to-night, Jack?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Into town?”</span> laughed the young skipper.
<span class="tei tei-q">“I went last night—and some of the folks didn't
do a thing to me, did they?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page112">[pg 112]</span><a name="Pg112" id="Pg112" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Aren't you going to report the robbery to
the police?”</span> demanded Hal, opening his eyes in
surprise.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Not in a rush,”</span> Jack answered. <span class="tei tei-q">“If I do,
the police may start at once, and that mulatto
and his friends, being on the watch, will take
the alarm and get away. If I wait two or three
days, then the mulatto's crowd will think I've
dropped the whole thing. I reckon the waiting
game will fool them more than any other.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, and all the money they got away from
you will be spent,”</span> muttered Eph.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jack, none the less, decided to wait and think
the matter over.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Supper over, the submarine boys, for want of
anything else to do, sat and read until about nine
o'clock. Then Jack looked up.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“This is getting mighty tedious,”</span> he complained.
<span class="tei tei-q">“What do you fellows say to getting
on shore and stretching our legs in a good
walk?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“In town?”</span> grinned Eph, slyly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jack flushed, then grinned.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No!”</span> he answered quietly; <span class="tei tei-q">“about the
Academy grounds.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I wonder if it would be against the regulations
for a lot of rank outsiders like us to go
through the grounds at this hour?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“'Rank outsiders'?”</span> mimicked Jack Benson,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg 113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
laughing. <span class="tei tei-q">“You forget, Hal, old fellow, that
we're instruct—hem! civilian instructors—here.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I wonder, though, if it would be in good
taste for us to go prowling through the grounds
at this hour?”</span> persisted Hal.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“There's one sure way to find out,”</span> proposed
Benson. <span class="tei tei-q">“We can try it, and, if no marine sentry
chases us, we can conclude that we're moving
about within our rights. Come along, fellows.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Putting on their caps, the three went up on
the platform deck. The engine room door was
locked and Williamson and Truax had already
turned in. There was a shore boat at the landing.
Jack sent a low-voiced hail that brought
the boat out alongside.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Will it be proper for us to go through the
Academy grounds at this hour?”</span> Jack inquired
of the petty officer in the stern.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, sir; there's no regulation against it.
And, anyway, sir, you're all stationed here, just
now.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Thank you. Then please take us ashore.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this hour the walks through the grounds
were nearly deserted. A few officers, and some
of their ladies living at the naval station, were
out. The cadets were all in their quarters in
barracks, hard at study, or supposed to be.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For some time the submarine boys strolled
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
about, enjoying the air and the views they obtained
of buildings and grounds. Back at Dunhaven
the air had been frosty. Here, at this
more southern port, the October night was
balmy, wholly pleasant.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I wonder if these cadets here ever have any
real fun?”</span> questioned Eph Somers.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I've heard—or read—that they do,”</span>
laughed Hal.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What sort of fun?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, for one thing, the cadets of the upper
classes haze the plebe cadets a good deal.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Humph! That's fun for all but the plebes.
Who are the plebes, anyway?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The new cadets; the youngest class at the
Academy,”</span> Hal replied.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What do they do to the plebe?”</span> Eph wanted
to know.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I guess the only way you could find that out,
Eph, would be to join the plebe class.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Reckon, when I come to Annapolis, I'll enter
the class above the plebe,”</span> retorted Somers.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The three submarine boys had again approached
the cadet barracks building.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Here comes a cadet now, Eph,”</span> whispered
Jack. <span class="tei tei-q">“If he has the time, I don't doubt he'd
be glad to answer any questions you may have
for him.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Young Benson offered this suggestion in a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a name="Pg115" id="Pg115" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
spirit of mischief, hoping the approaching cadet,
when questioned, would resent it stiffly. Then
Eph would be almost certain to flare up.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The cadet, however, suddenly turned, coming
straight toward them, smiling.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Good evening, gentlemen,”</span> was the cadet's
greeting.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Good evening,”</span> was Jack's hearty reply.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You've never been here before, have you,
sir?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Never,”</span> Jack confessed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Then I take it you have never, sir, seen the
camelroorelephant?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The cam—”</span> began Eph Somers.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then he stopped, clapping both hands to his
right jaw.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Won't you please hand that to us in
pieces?”</span> begged Eph, speaking as though with
difficulty.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The cadet laughed heartily, then added:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Don't try to pronounce it, gentlemen, until
you've seen the camelroorelephant. It's a cadet
joke, but it's well worth seeing. Shall I take
you to it?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, yes, if you'll be good enough,”</span> Jack
assented, heartily.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The cadet glanced quickly about him, then
said in a low voice:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“This way, please, gentlemen.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116" id="Pg116" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
He led the strangers quickly around the end
of barracks to an open space in the rear. Here
he halted.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Gentlemen, I must ask you to close your
eyes, and keep them closed, on honor, until I ask
you to open them again. You won't have to
keep your eyes closed more than sixty seconds
before the camelroorelephant will be ready for
inspection. Now, eyes closed, please.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lingering only long enough to make sure that
his request had been met, the cadet stole noiselessly
away.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nor was it many seconds later when all three
of the submarine boys began to feel suddenly
suspicious.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I'm going to open my eyes,”</span> whispered
Eph.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You're on honor not to,”</span> warned Jack Benson,
also in a whisper.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I didn't give my word,”</span> retorted Eph, <span class="tei tei-q">“and
I'm going to—oh, great shades of Santiago!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The very genuine note of concern in Eph's
voice caused Jack and Hal to open their own
eyes instantly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nor could any of the three repress a quick
start.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From all quarters naval cadets were advancing
stealthily upon them. Something in the
very attitude and poise of the young men told
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg 117]</span><a name="Pg117" id="Pg117" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the submarine boys that these naval cadets were
out for mischief.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“We're in for it!”</span> breathed Jack, in an undertone.
<span class="tei tei-q">“We're in for something real and
startling, I reckon. Fellows, brace up and take
your medicine, whatever it is, like men!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nor was Jack's guess in the least wrong.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Even had the submarine boys attempted
to bolt they would have found
it impossible. They were surrounded.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The cadets closed quickly in upon them.
There were more than thirty of these budding
young naval officers.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was Cadet Merriam who stepped straight
up to Jack, giving him a grotesque and exaggerated
salute, as he rumbled out:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Good evening, SIR!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Like a flash Jack Benson comprehended.
These cadets intended fully to even up matters
for having been obliged to say <span class="tei tei-q">“sir”</span> to these
very youthful <span class="tei tei-q">“civilian instructors.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Good evening,”</span> Jack smiled.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"You have come to see the camelroorelephant,
SIR?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“We've been told that we might have that
pleasure,”</span> Jack responded, still smiling.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Perhaps you may,”</span> retorted Cadet Merriam,
<span class="tei tei-q">“though, first of all, it will be necessary
to prove yourselves worthy of the privilege,
SIR.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Anything within our power,”</span> promised
Jack.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Then, SIR, let me see you all three stand 'at
attention.'”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“At attention”</span> is the rigid attitude taken by
a United States soldier or sailor when in the
presence of his officers. Jack had already seen
men in that attitude, and did his best to imitate
it in smart military manner. Eph and Hal did
likewise.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No, no, no, you dense blockheads!”</span> uttered
Cadet Midshipman Merriam. <span class="tei tei-q">“'At attention'
upside down—on your hands!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The other cadet midshipmen now hemmed in
closely about the three. Jack thought he caught
the idea. He bent over, throwing his feet up in
the air and resting on his hands. Unable to
keep his balance, he walked two or three steps.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I didn't tell you to walk your post, blockhead!”</span>
scowled Mr. Merriam. <span class="tei tei-q">“Stand still
when at attention.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jack tried, but of course made a ludicrous
failure of standing still on his hands. So did
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg 119]</span><a name="Pg119" id="Pg119" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Hal and Eph. The latter, truth to tell, didn't
try very hard, for his freckled temper was coming
a bit to the surface.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You're the rawest recruits, the worst landlubbers
I've ever seen,”</span> declared Cadet Midshipman
Merriam, with severe dignity. <span class="tei tei-q">“Rest,
before you try it any further.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The smile had all but left Jack Benson's lips,
though he tried to keep it there. Hal Hastings
made the most successful attempt at looking
wholly unconcerned. Eph's face was growing
redder every minute. It is a regrettable fact
that Eph was really beginning to want to fight.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“See here,”</span> ordered Mr. Merriam, suddenly,
taking Jack by the arm, <span class="tei tei-q">“you're a horse, a full-blooded
Arab steed—understand!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He gave young Benson a push that sent that
youngster down to the ground on all fours.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You're General Washington, out to take a
ride on your horse,”</span> announced Mr. Merriam,
turning to Hal. <span class="tei tei-q">“It's a ride for your health.
Do you understand? It will be wholly for your
health to take that ride!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hal Hastings couldn't help comprehending.
With a sheepish grin he sat astride of Jack Benson's
back as the latter stood on all fours.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Go ahead with your ride, General,”</span> called
Mr. Merriam.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jack pranced as best he could, on all fours,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page120">[pg 120]</span><a name="Pg120" id="Pg120" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Hal making the load of his own weight as light
as he could. Over the ground the pair moved
in this nonsensical ride, the cadets following and
grinning their appreciation of the nonsense.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Two of the young men followed, holding Eph
by the arms between them. Mr. Merriam now
turned upon the unhappy freckled boy.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Down on all fours,”</span> ordered Mr. Merriam.
<span class="tei tei-q">“You're the measly dog that barked at General
Washington on that famous ride. Bark, you
wretched yellow cur—bark, bark, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">bark</span></span>!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Though Eph Somers was madder than ever,
he had just enough judgment remaining to feel
that the wisest thing would be to obey instructions.
So, on all fours, Eph raced after Jack,
barking at him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“See how frightened the horse is,”</span> muttered
one of the midshipmen.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Taking the hint, Jack shied as well as he
could.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“That's all,”</span> said Mr. Merriam, at last.
<span class="tei tei-q">“All of that, at least.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the three submarine boys rose, each found
himself gently held by a pair of cadet midshipmen.
It was a more or less polite hint that the
ordeal was not yet over. Mr. Merriam turned to
whisper to one of the cadets, who darted inside
the barracks building. He was back, promptly,
carrying a folded blanket on his arm.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg 123]</span><a name="Pg123" id="Pg123" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
A grin spread over the faces of the assembled
cadet midshipmen. The bearer of the blanket
at once unfolded it. As many of the cadets as
could got hold of the edges, bending, holding the
blanket spread out over the ground.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jack Benson's two captors suddenly hurled
him across the length of the blanket with no gentle
force. Instantly the cadets holding the
blankets straightened up, jerking it taut. Up
into the air a couple of feet bounded Jack. As
his body came down the cadets holding the
blanket gave it a still harder jerk. This time
Jack shot up into the air at least four feet. It
was the same old blanket-tossing, long popular
both in the Army and Navy. Every time Jack
landed the blanket was given a harder jerk by
those holding it. Benson began to go higher
and higher.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now the cadets broke into a low, monotonous
chant, in time to their movements. It
ran:</p>

<div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left; text-indent: 2.00em">Sir, sir, surcingle!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left; text-indent: 4.00em">Sir, sir, circle!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left; text-indent: 2.00em">Sir, sir, with a shingle—</div>
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left; text-indent: 4.00em">Sir, sir, sir!</div>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As regular as drumbeats the cadets ripped out
the syllables of the refrain. At each word Jack
Benson's body shot higher and higher. These
young men were experts in the gentle art of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span><a name="Pg124" id="Pg124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
blanket-tossing. Ere long the submarine boy
was going up into the air some eight or nine feet
at every tautening of the blanket.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As for escape, that was out of the question.
No sooner did the submarine boy touch the
blanket than he shot skyward again. Had he
desired to he could not have called out. The
motion and the sudden jolts shook all the breath
out of him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ugh! Hm! Pleasant, isn't it?”</span> uttered
Hal Hastings, grimly, under his breath.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“If they try to do that to me,”</span> whispered
Eph, hotly, under his breath, <span class="tei tei-q">“I'll fight.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“More simpleton you, then!”</span> Hal shot back
at him in warning. <span class="tei tei-q">“What chance do you think
you stand against a crowd like this?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Just as suddenly as it had begun the blanket-tossing
stopped. Yet, hardly had Jack been allowed
to step out than Hal Hastings was unceremoniously
dropped athwart the blanket. The
tossing began again, to the chant of:</p>

<div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left; text-indent: 2.00em">Sir, sir, surcingle!</div>
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left; text-indent: 4.00em">Sir, sir, circle!</div>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Right plentifully were these cadet midshipmen
avenging themselves for having had to say
<span class="tei tei-q">“sir”</span> to these young submarine boys that day.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Woof!”</span> breathed Jack, as soon as breath
entered his body again. Eph clenched his fists
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg 125]</span><a name="Pg125" id="Pg125" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
tightly, as Hal continued to go higher and
higher. But at last Hastings's ordeal was over.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I suppose they'll try that on me!”</span> gritted
Eph Somers to himself. <span class="tei tei-q">“If they do—”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That was far as he got, for Eph was suddenly
flung upon the blanket.</p>

<div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left; text-indent: 2.00em">Sir, sir, surcingle!</div>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then how Eph <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">did</span></span> go up and down! It was
as though these cadet midshipmen knew that it
would make Eph mad, madder, maddest! These
budding young naval officers fairly bent to their
work, tautening and loosening on the blanket
until their muscles fairly ached.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was lofty aerial work that Eph Somers was
doing. Up and up—higher and higher! Without
the need of any effort on his own part young
Somers was now traveling upward at the rate of
ten or eleven feet at every punctuated bound.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then, suddenly, there came a sound that
chilled the blood of every young cadet midshipman
hazer present.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Halt!</span></span> Where you are!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Under the shadow of the barracks building a
naval officer had appeared. He now came forward,
a frown on his face, eyeing the culprits.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is no merry jest for cadet midshipmen to
be caught at hazing! And here were some
thirty of them—red-handed!</p>
</div>

<div class="tei tei-div" style="margin-bottom: 5.00em; margin-top: 5.00em">

<h1 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 3.46em; margin-top: 3.46em"><span style="font-size: 173%">CHAPTER XII: JACK BENSON, EXPERT EXPLAINER</span></h1>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At the first word of command from the
officer several of the cadet midshipmen
who were near enough to an open doorway
vanished through it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the officer strode through the group of
startled young men a few more, left behind his
back, made a silent disappearance.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There were left, however, as the officer looked
about him, sixteen of the young men, all too
plainly headed and led by Cadet Midshipman
Merriam.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Young gentlemen,”</span> said the officer, severely,
<span class="tei tei-q">“I regret to find so many of you engaged in
hazing. It is doubly bad when your victims are
men outside the corps. And, if I mistake not,
these young gentlemen are here as temporary
civilian instructors in submarine work.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Merriam and his comrades made no reply
in words. Nor did their faces express much.
They stood at attention, looking stolidly ahead
of them, though their faces were turned toward
the officer. It was not the place of any of them
to speak unless the officer asked questions.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Severe as the hazing had been, however, Jack
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and Hal, at least, had taken it all in good part.
Nor was Jack bound by any of the rules of etiquette
that prevented the cadets from speaking.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“May I offer a word, sir?”</span> asked Jack,
wheeling upon the officer.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You were one of the victims of a hazing,
were you not?”</span> demanded the officer, regarding
Jack, keenly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, could you call it that, sir?”</span> asked
Jack, a look of innocent surprise settling on his
face. <span class="tei tei-q">“We called it a demonstration—an
explanation.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Demonstration? Explanation?”</span> repeated
the officer, astonished in his turn. <span class="tei tei-q">“What do
you mean, Mr.—er—?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Benson,”</span> Jack supplied, quietly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I think you would better tell me a little more,
Mr. Benson,”</span> pursued the unknown naval
officer.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, it was like this, sir,”</span> Jack continued.
<span class="tei tei-q">“My two friends—Hastings and Somers—and
myself were talking about the West Point and
Annapolis hazings, of which we had heard and
read. We were talking about the subject when
a cadet came along. I suggested to Somers that
we ask the cadet about hazing. Well, sir, to
make a long story short, some of the cadets
undertook to show us just how hazing is—or
used to be—done at Annapolis.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg 128]</span><a name="Pg128" id="Pg128" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Oh! Then it was all thoroughly good-natured,
all in the way of a joke, to show you
something you wanted to know?”</span> asked the
naval officer, slowly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“That's the way I took it,”</span> replied Jack.
<span class="tei tei-q">“So did Hastings and Somers. We've enjoyed
ourselves more than anyone else here has.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This was truth surely enough, for, in the last
two minutes, not one of the cadet midshipmen
present could have been accused of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">enjoying</span></span>
himself.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Then what took place here, Mr. Benson,
really took place at your request?”</span> insisted the
naval officer.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It all answered the questions that we had
been asking,”</span> Jack replied, promptly, though,
it must be admitted, rather evasively.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“This is your understanding, too, Mr. Hastings?”</span>
demanded the officer.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Surely,”</span> murmured Hal.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You, Mr. Somers?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I—I haven't had so much fun since the gasoline
engine blew up,”</span> protested Eph.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“We entered most heartily into the spirit of
the thing,”</span> Jack hastened on to say, <span class="tei tei-q">“and feel
that we owe the deepest thanks to these young
gentlemen of the Navy. Yet, if our desire to
know more about the life—that is, the former
life—of the Academy is to result in getting our
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg 129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
entertainers into any trouble, we shall never
cease regretting our unfortunate curiosity.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For some moments the naval officer regarded
the three submarine boys, solemnly, in turn.
From them he turned to look over the cadet midshipmen.
The latter looked as stolid, and stood
as rigidly at attention, as ever.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Under this presentation of the matter,”</span> said
the officer, after a long pause, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am not prepared
to say that there has been any violation
of discipline. At least, no grave infraction.
However, some of these young gentlemen are, I
believe, absent from their quarters without
leave. Mr. Merriam?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I have permission to be absent from my
quarters between nine and ten, sir.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Mr. Caldwell?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Absent from quarters without permission,
sir.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So on down through the list the officer ran.
Nine of the young men proved to have leave to
be away from their quarters. The other seven
did not have such permission. The names of
these seven, therefore, were written down to be
reported. The seven, too, were ordered at once
back to their quarters.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having issued his instructions, the naval officer
turned and walked away. Jack and his
comrades, too, left the scene.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Yet they had not gone far when they heard
a low hail behind. Turning, they saw Cadet
Midshipmen Merriam hastening toward them.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Gentlemen,”</span> he said, earnestly, as he
reached them, <span class="tei tei-q">“it may not be best for me to be
seen lingering here to talk with you. But my
comrades wanted me to come after you and to
say that we think you bricks. You carried that
off finely, Mr. Benson. None of us will ever
forget it.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It wasn't much to do,”</span> smiled Jack,
pleasantly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It was quick-witted of you, and generous
too, sir,”</span> rejoined Mr. Merriam, finding it now
very easy to employ the <span class="tei tei-q">“sir.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Probably you
agree with us that no great crime was committed,
anyway. But, just the same, hazing is
under a heavy ban these days. If you hadn't
saved the day as you did, sir, all of our cadet
party might have been dismissed the Service.
Those absent from quarters without leave
will get only a few demerits apiece. We
have that much to thank you for, sir, and we
do. All our thanks, remember. Good night,
sir.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My courage was down in my boots for a
while,”</span> confessed Hal Hastings, as the three
chums continued their walk back to the Basin.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“When?”</span> demanded Eph, grimly. <span class="tei tei-q">“When
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg 131]</span><a name="Pg131" id="Pg131" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
your boots—and the rest of you—were so high
up in the air over the blanket?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No; when the cadets were caught at it,”</span>
replied Hal.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Say, Jack,”</span> demanded Eph, <span class="tei tei-q">“do you ever
give much thought to the future life?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Meaning the life in the next world?”</span> questioned
Benson.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I sometimes give a good deal of thought to
it,”</span> Jack confessed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Then where do you expect to go, when the
time comes?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“After the whoppers you told that officer?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I didn't tell him even a single tiny fib,”</span> protested
Jack, indignantly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, you George Washington!”</span> choked Eph
Somers.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, I didn't,”</span> insisted Jack. <span class="tei tei-q">“Now, just
stop and think. Weren't we all three discussing
hazing?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Then that part of what I told the officer was
straight. Now, Eph, when we saw that first
cadet come along, didn't I suggest to you to ask
him about hazing?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ye-es,”</span> admitted Somers, thoughtfully.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Then, didn't the cadet midshipmen offer to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg 132]</span><a name="Pg132" id="Pg132" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
show us all about hazing pranks, and didn't they
do it?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, rather,”</span> muttered Eph.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Now, young man, that's all I told the officer,
except that we enjoyed our entertainment
greatly.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Did</span></span> we enjoy it, though?”</span> demanded Eph
Somers, bridling up.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I did,”</span> replied Jack, <span class="tei tei-q">“and I spoke for myself.
I enjoyed it as I would enjoy almost any
new experience.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“So did I,”</span> added Hal, warmly. <span class="tei tei-q">“It was
rough—mighty rough—but now I know what an
Annapolis hazing is like, and I'm glad I do.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, I want to tell you I didn't enjoy it,”</span>
blazed Eph. <span class="tei tei-q">“It was a mighty cheeky—”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Then why did you let the officer imagine you
enjoyed it?”</span> taunted Jack.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While Hal put in, slyly:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Eph, you're too quick to talk about others
fibbing. From the evidence just put in, it's
evident that you're the only one of the three who
fibbed any. Won't you please walk on the
other side of the road? I never did like to
travel with liars.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, you go to Jericho!”</span> flared Eph. But,
as he walked along, he blinked a good deal, and
did some hard thinking.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I'll tell you,”</span> broke out Jack, suddenly,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span><a name="Pg133" id="Pg133" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“who thanks us even more than the cadets themselves
do.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Who?”</span> queried Hal.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“That officer who caught the crowd at it.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Do you think he cared?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Of course he did,”</span> said Jack, positively.
<span class="tei tei-q">“He'd rather have gone hungry for a couple of
days than have to report that bunch for
hazing.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Then why was he so infernally stiff with
the young men?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“He had to be; that's the answer. That officer,
like every other officer of the Navy detailed
here, is sworn to do his full duty. So he has to
enforce the regulations. But don't you suppose,
fellows, that officer was hazed, and did
some hazing on his own account, when he was
a cadet midshipman here years ago? Of course!
And that's why the officer didn't question us any
more closely than he did. He was afraid he
might stumble on something that would oblige
him to report the whole crowd for hazing. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">He</span></span>
didn't want to do it. That officer, I'm certain,
knew that, if he questioned us too closely, he'd
find a lot more beneath the surface that he
simply didn't want to dig up.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Would you have told the truth, if he had
questioned you searchingly, and pinned you
right down?”</span> demanded Eph Somers.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg 134]</span><a name="Pg134" id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Of course I would,”</span> Jack replied, soberly.
<span class="tei tei-q">“I'm no liar. But I feel deeply grateful to that
officer for not being keener.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before nine o'clock the next morning news of
the night's doings back of barracks had spread
through the entire corps of cadet midshipmen.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With these young men of the Navy there was
but one opinion of the submarine boys—that
they were trumps, wholly of the right sort.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As a result, Jack, Hal and Eph had hundreds
of new friends among those who will officer the
Navy of the morrow.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Not so bad, even just as a stroke of business!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For the next ten days things moved along
without much excitement for the submarine
boys.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During that time they had an average of four
sections a day of cadet midshipmen to instruct
in the workings of the Pollard type of submarine
torpedo boat.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During the last few days short cruises were
taken on the Severn River, in order that the
middies might practise at running the motors
and handling the craft. At such times one
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg 135]</span><a name="Pg135" id="Pg135" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
squad of midshipmen would be on duty in the
engine room, another in the conning tower and
on the platform deck.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of course, when the midshipmen handled the
<span class="tei tei-q">“Farnum,”</span> under command of a Navy officer,
the submarine boys had but little more to do
than to be on board. Certainly they were not
overworked. Yet all three were doing fine
work for their employers in making the Navy
officers of the future like the Pollard type of
craft.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After waiting a few days Jack Benson reported
to the Annapolis police his experience
with the mulatto <span class="tei tei-q">“guide.”</span> The police thought
they recognized the fellow, from the description,
and did their best to find him. The mulatto,
however, seemed to have disappeared from that
part of the country.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There came a Friday afternoon when, as the
last detachment of middies filed over the side
into the waiting cutter, Lieutenant Commander
Mayhew announced:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“This, Mr. Benson, completes the instruction
desired in the Basin and in the river. To-morrow
and Sunday you will have for rest. On
Monday, at 10 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.m.</span></span>, a section will report aboard
for the first trip out to sea. Then you will show
our young men how the boat dives, and how she
is run under water. As none of our cadet midshipmen
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span><a name="Pg136" id="Pg136" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
have ever been below in a submarine
before, you will be sure of having eager
students.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And perhaps some nervous ones,”</span> smiled
Skipper Jack.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Possibly,”</span> assented Mr. Mayhew. <span class="tei tei-q">“I doubt
it, though. Nervousness is not a marked trait
of any young man who has been long enrolled at
the Naval Academy.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Can we have a slight favor done us, Mr.
Mayhew?”</span> Jack asked.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Any reasonable favor, of course.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Then, sir, we'd like to spend a little time
ashore, as we've been confined so long aboard.
If I lock up everything tight on the boat until
Sunday night, may we know that the 'Farnum'
will be under the protection of the marine
guard?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I feel that there will not be the slightest difficulty
in promising you that,”</span> replied Mr. Mayhew.
<span class="tei tei-q">“I will telephone the proper authorities
about it as soon as I go on shore.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All hands on board were pleased over the
prospect of going ashore, with the exception of
Sam Truax.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You don't need any guard on the boat,”</span> he
protested. <span class="tei tei-q">“I don't want to go ashore. Leave
me here and I'll be all the guard necessary.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“We're all going ashore,”</span> Jack replied.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“But I haven't any money to spend ashore,”</span>
objected Truax.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I'll let you have ten dollars on account,
then,”</span> replied Jack, who was well supplied with
money, thanks to a draft received from Jacob
Farnum.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I don't want to go ashore, anyway.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I'm sorry, Truax, but it doesn't really make
any difference. The boat will be closed up
tight, and there wouldn't be any place for you
to stay, except on the platform deck.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You're not treating me fairly,”</span> protested
Sam Truax, indignantly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I'm sorry you think so. Still, if you're not
satisfied, all I can do is to pay you off to date.
Then you can go where you please.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I'm here by David Pollard's order. Do you
forget that?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“He sent you along to us, true,”</span> admitted
Jack, <span class="tei tei-q">“but I have instructions from Mr. Farnum
to dismiss anyone whose work on board I
don't like. Now, Truax, you're a competent
enough man in the engine room, and there's no
sense in having to let you go. You're well paid,
and can afford the time on shore. I wouldn't
make any more fuss about this, but do as the
rest of us are going to do.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, I'll have to, then, since you're boss
here,”</span> grumbled Truax, sulkily.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span><a name="Pg138" id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“I don't want to make it felt too much that I
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">am</span></span> boss here,”</span> Jack retorted, mildly. <span class="tei tei-q">“At the
same time, though, I'm held responsible, and
so I suppose I'll have to have things done the
way that seems best to me.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sam Truax turned to get his satchel. The
instant his back was turned on the young commander
Sam's face was a study in ugliness.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, I'll take this all out of you,”</span> muttered
the fellow to himself. <span class="tei tei-q">“I don't believe, Jack
Benson, you'll go on the cruising next week.
If you do, you won't be much good, anyway!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ten minutes later a shore boat landed the
entire party from the submarine craft.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Going with the rest of us, Truax?”</span> inquired
Jack, pleasantly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No; I'm going to find a boarding-house.
That will be cheaper than the hotel.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So the other four kept straight on to the
Maryland House, giving very little more thought
to the sulky one.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was not until after supper that Eph turned
the talk back to Sam Truax.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I don't like the fellow, at all,”</span> declared
young Somers. <span class="tei tei-q">“He always wants to be left
alone in the engine room, for one thing.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And I've made it my business, regular,”</span>
added Williamson, the machinist, <span class="tei tei-q">“to see that
he doesn't have his wish.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg 139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“He's always sulky, and kicking about everything,”</span>
added Eph. <span class="tei tei-q">“I may be wrong, but I
can't get it out of my head that the fellow came
aboard on purpose to be a trouble-maker.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, what object could he have in that?”</span>
asked Captain Jack.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Blessed if I know,”</span> replied Eph. <span class="tei tei-q">“But
that's the way I size the fellow up. Now, take
that time you were knocked senseless, back in
Dunhaven. Who could have done that? The
more I think about Sam Truax, the more I suspect
him as the fellow who stretched you out.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Again, what object could he have?”</span> inquired
Benson.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Blessed if I know. What object could anyone
have in such a trick against you? It was a
state prison job, if the fellow had been caught
at the time.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, there's one thing Truax was innocent
of, anyway,”</span> laughed Captain Jack. <span class="tei tei-q">“He
didn't have any hand in the way I was tricked
and robbed by the mulatto.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Blamed if I'm so sure he didn't have a hand
in that, too,”</span> contended Eph Somers, stubbornly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yet Mr. Pollard recommended him,”</span> urged
Jack.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, and a fine fellow Dave Pollard is—true
as steel,”</span> put in Hal Hastings, quietly. <span class="tei tei-q">“Yet
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg 140]</span><a name="Pg140" id="Pg140" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
you know what a dreamer he is. Always has his
head in the air and his thoughts among the stars.
He'd as like as not take a fellow like Truax on
the fellow's own say-so, and never think of looking
him up.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, we've no reason to think Truax isn't
honest enough,”</span> contended Jack Benson.
<span class="tei tei-q">“He's certainly a fine workman. As to his
being sulky, you know well enough that's a common
fault among men who spend their lives listening
to the noise of great engines. A man
who can't make himself heard over the noise of
a big engine hasn't much encouragement to talk.
Now, a man who can't find much chance to talk
becomes sulky a good many times out of ten.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“We'll have trouble with that fellow, Truax,
yet,”</span> muttered Eph.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, I hope not,”</span> Jack answered, then added,
significantly:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“If he <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">does</span></span> start any trouble he may find that
he has been trifling with the wrong crowd!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Very little more thought was given to the
sulky one. The submarine boys and their companion,
Williamson, enjoyed Saturday and
Sunday ashore.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All of them might have felt disturbed, however,
had they known of one thing that happened.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The naval machinists aboard the first submarine
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg 141]</span><a name="Pg141" id="Pg141" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
boat, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Pollard,”</span> now owned by the
United States Government, found something
slightly out of order with the <span class="tei tei-q">“Pollard's”</span>
engine that they did not know exactly how to
remedy.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sam Truax, hanging around the Basin that
Sunday forenoon, was called upon. He gladly
responded to the call for help. For four hours
he toiled along in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Pollard's”</span> engine room.
Much of that time he spent there alone.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The job done, at last, Truax quietly received
the thanks of the naval machinists and went
ashore again.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet, as he turned and walked toward the main
gate of the grounds, there was a smile on Sam
Truax's face that was little short of diabolical.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Now, if I can only get the same chance at the
'Farnum's' engines!”</span> he muttered, to himself.
<span class="tei tei-q">“If I can, I think Mr. Jack Benson will find himself
out of favor with his company, for his company
will be out of favor with the Navy Department
at Washington!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The submarine boats when out in the
Bay will keep abreast of the 'Hudson,'
two hundred yards off on either
beam. The speed will be fourteen knots when
the signal is given for full speed. The general
course, after leaving the mouth of the Bay will
be East.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such were the instructions called from the
rail of the gunboat, through a megaphone,
Monday forenoon.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On each of the submarine craft were sixteen
cadet midshipmen, out for actual practice in
handling a submarine in diving and in running
under water. On board the gunboat were eighty
more cadets. Thus a large class of the young
men were to receive instruction during the
cruise, for the detachments aboard the submarines
could be changed at the pleasure of
Lieutenant Commander Mayhew, who was in
charge of the cruise.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Captain Jack, his own hands on the conning
tower wheel, ran the <span class="tei tei-q">“Farnum”</span> out into the
river, first of all. Then the <span class="tei tei-q">“Pollard,”</span> under
command of a naval officer, followed. Both
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg 143]</span><a name="Pg143" id="Pg143" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
backed water, then waited for the <span class="tei tei-q">“Hudson”</span> to
come out, for the gunboat was to lead the way
until the Bay was reached. Then the formation
ordered would be followed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Though it was nearing the first of November,
the day, near land, was ideally soft and balmy.
As many of the midshipmen as could sought the
platform deck of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Farnum.”</span> Those, however,
who belonged to the engineer division were
obliged to spend the greater part of their time
below.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By the time that the three craft were in the
ordered formation, abreast, and well started
down Chesapeake Bay, the parent vessel signaled
that the designated cadets were to take
charge of the handling of the submarine
boats.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jack Benson cheerfully relinquished the wheel
to Cadet Midshipman Merriam, and stepped out
on to the platform deck. At need, as in case of
accident or misunderstanding of signals or
orders, Benson was still in command. While all
ran smoothly, however, Mr. Merriam enjoyed
command.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hal, being likewise relieved in the engine
room, came also out on deck.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Where's Eph?”</span> inquired the young commander
of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Farnum.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“In the engine room,”</span> smiled Hal. <span class="tei tei-q">“He said
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg 144]</span><a name="Pg144" id="Pg144" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
I could leave, if I wanted, but that he'd be
hanged if he'd let Truax out of his sight while
I was away.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Eph seems to have Truax on the brain,”</span>
laughed Jack.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, Truax <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></span> a queer and surly one,”</span> Hal
admitted. <span class="tei tei-q">“This morning he gives one the impression
of peeking over his shoulder all the
time to see whether he's being watched.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“So Eph means to humor him by watching
him, eh?”</span> asked Jack.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hal laughed quietly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some of the cadets who were familiar with
the landmarks of Chesapeake Bay pointed out
many of the localities and sights to the two
submarine boys.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At last, however, Eph was obliged to call for
Hal.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You know, Hal, old fellow, I've got to look
out for the feeding of a lot of boarders to-day,”</span>
complained Eph, whimsically.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This task of Eph's took time, though it was
not a hard one. The food for the cadets had
been sent aboard. Eph had to make coffee and
heat soup. For the rest, cold food had to do.
The young men, on this trip, were required to
wait on themselves.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hal found Sam Truax sitting moodily in a
corner of the engine room, though there was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg 145]</span><a name="Pg145" id="Pg145" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
something about the fellow's appearance that
suggested the watchfulness of a cat.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why don't you go on deck a while, Truax?”</span>
asked Hal, kindly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Don't want to,”</span> snapped the fellow, irritably.
So Hal turned his back on the man.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Doesn't that part need loosening up a bit,
sir?”</span> asked the cadet in charge of the engineer
division.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> replied Hastings, after watching a
moment; <span class="tei tei-q">“it does.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I'll do it, then,”</span> proposed Truax, roughly.
He attempted to crowd his way past Hal, but the
latter refused to be crowded, and stood his
ground until the midshipman passed him a
wrench. Then Hastings loosened up the part.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You might let me do a little something,”</span>
growled Sam Truax, in a tone intentionally
offensive.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Don't forget, Truax, that I'm in command
in this department,”</span> retorted Hal, in a quieter
tone than usual, though with a direct, steady
look that made Sam Truax turn white with
repressed wrath.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You won't let me forget it, will you?”</span>
snarled the fellow.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No; for I don't want you to forget it, and
least of all on this cruise,”</span> responded Hal Hastings.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg 146]</span><a name="Pg146" id="Pg146" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“You don't give me any chance to—”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Silence!”</span> ordered Hal, taking a step toward
him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sam Truax opened his mouth to make some
retort, then wisely changed his mind, dropping
back into his former seat.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The noon meal was served to all hands. By
the time it was well over the mouth of the Bay
was in sight, the broad Atlantic rolling in
beyond.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sea, when reached, proved to be almost
smooth. It was ideal weather for such a cruise.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then straight East, for an hour they went,
getting well out of the path of coasting vessels.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Hullo! What in blazes does that mean?”</span>
suddenly demanded Hal, pointing astern at
starboard.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <span class="tei tei-q">“Pollard”</span> lay tossing gently on the
water, making no headway. Hardly ten seconds
later the <span class="tei tei-q">“Hudson”</span> signaled a halt.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then followed some rapid signaling between
the gunboat and the submarine that had
stopped. There was some break in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Pollard's”</span>
machinery, but the cause had not yet
been determined.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Blazes!”</span> muttered Jack, uneasily. <span class="tei tei-q">“It
couldn't have happened at a worse time. This
looks bad for our firm, Hal!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <span class="tei tei-q">“Farnum”</span> now lay to, as did the <span class="tei tei-q">“Hudson,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg 147]</span><a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for the officer in command of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Pollard”</span>
signaled that his machinists were making
a rapid but thorough investigation of the unfortunate
submarine's engines.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Finally, a cutter put off from the <span class="tei tei-q">“Hudson,”</span>
with a cadet midshipman in charge. The small
boat came over alongside, and the midshipman
called up:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The lieutenant commander's compliments,
and will Mr. Benson detail Mr. Hastings to go
over to the 'Pollard' and assist?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My compliments to the lieutenant commander,”</span>
Jack replied. <span class="tei tei-q">“And be good enough
to report to him, please, that Mr. Hastings and
I will both go.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My orders, sir, are to convey you to the
'Pollard' before reporting back to the parent
vessel,”</span> replied the midshipman.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The cutter came alongside, taking off the two
submarine boys, while Eph Somers devoted himself
to watching Sam Truax as a bloodhound
might have hung to a trail.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Arrived on board the good, old, familiar
<span class="tei tei-q">“Pollard,”</span> Jack and Hal hurried below.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The machinery is too hot to handle, now,
sir,”</span> reported one of the naval machinists, <span class="tei tei-q">“but
it looks as though something was wrong right in
there”</span>—pointing.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Put one of the electric fans at work there, at
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
once,”</span> directed Hal. <span class="tei tei-q">“Then things ought to be
cool enough in half an hour, to make an examination
possible.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After seeing this done, the two submarine boys
left for the platform deck, for the engine room
was both hot and crowded.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“How long is it going to take you, Mr. Hastings?”</span>
asked the naval officer in command of the
<span class="tei tei-q">“Pollard.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Half an hour to get the parts cool enough
to examine, but I can't say, sir, how long the
examination and repairs will take.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So the officer in command signaled what
proved to be vague and unsatisfactory information
to Lieutenant Commander Mayhew.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“This is a bad time to have this sort of thing
happen,”</span> observed the naval officer in charge.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“A mighty bad time, sir,”</span> Jack murmured.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And the engines of the 'Pollard' were supposed
to be in first-class condition.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“They <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">were</span></span> in A-1 condition, when the boat
was turned over to the Navy,”</span> Jack responded.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Do you imagine, then, Mr. Benson, that
some of the naval machinists have been careless
or incompetent?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, that would be a wild guess to make,
sir, when one remembers what high rank your
naval machinists take in their work,”</span> Jack
Benson replied.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg 149]</span><a name="Pg149" id="Pg149" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“And this boat was sold to the Navy with the
strongest guarantee for the engines,”</span> pursued
the officer in charge.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jack and Hal were both worried. The sudden
break had a bad look for the Pollard boats,
in the success of which these submarine boys
were most vitally interested.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At last, from below, the suspected parts of
the engine were reported to be cool enough for
examination. The naval officer in charge followed
Jack and Hal below.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Taking off his uniform blouse and rolling up
his sleeves, Hal sailed in vigorously to locate the
fault. Machinists and cadets stood about, passing
him the tools he needed, and helping him
when required.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At last, after disconnecting some parts, Hal
drew out a long, slender brass piston.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As he held it up young Hastings's face went
as white as chalk.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Do you see this?”</span> he demanded, hoarsely.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Filed, crazily, and it also looks as though the
inner end had been heated and tampered with,”</span>
gasped Jack Benson.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“This, sir,”</span> complained Hal, turning around
to face the naval officer in charge, <span class="tei tei-q">“looks like a
direct attempt to tamper with and damage the
engine. Someone has done this deliberately,
sir. It only remains to find the culprit.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span><a name="Pg150" id="Pg150" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Then we'll find out,”</span> retorted the naval officer,
<span class="tei tei-q">“if it takes a court of inquiry and a court
martial to do it. But are you sure of your
charge, Mr. Hastings?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Am I sure?”</span> repeated Hal, all the soul of
the young engineer swelling to the surface.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Take this piston, sir, and examine it. Could
such a job have been done, unless by sheer
design and intent?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Will the lieutenant permit me to speak?”</span>
asked the senior machinist, taking a step forward
and saluting.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes; go ahead.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yesterday morning, sir,”</span> continued the
senior machinist, <span class="tei tei-q">“we thought the engines
needed some overhauling by someone more accustomed
to them than we were. We saw one
of the machinists of the 'Farnum,' sir, hanging
about on shore. So we invited him aboard and
asked him to look the engines over.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Describe the man,”</span> begged Jack.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The senior machinist gave a description that
instantly denoted Sam Truax as the man in
question.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Did you leave him alone in here, at any
time?”</span> demanded Hal.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Let me see. Why, yes, sir. The man must
have been alone in here some three-quarters of
an hour.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page151">[pg 151]</span><a name="Pg151" id="Pg151" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Jack and Hal exchanged swift glances.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There seemed, now, very little need of carrying
the investigation further.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When he could trust himself to speak
Hal Hastings addressed the naval
officer.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I think Mr. Benson and myself understand,
sir, how it happened that this damage was done.
There are extra parts in the repair kit. In
twenty minutes, sir, I think we can have the
engines running smoothly once more.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The naval officer was wise enough not to press
the questioning further just then. Instead, he
went on deck.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Working like beavers, and with the assistance
of others standing about, Jack and Hal had the
piston replaced and all the other parts in place
within fifteen minutes. Then, once more, Hal
turned on the gasoline, set the ignition, and
watched.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The engine ran as smoothly as ever.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“There won't be any more trouble, unless
someone is turned loose here with files and a
blast lamp,”</span> pronounced Hal. Then he and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page152">[pg 152]</span><a name="Pg152" id="Pg152" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his chum sought the deck, to report to the officer
in charge.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You think we're in running order, now?”</span>
asked that officer.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“If you give the speed-ahead signal, sir, I
think you'll feel as though you had a live engine
under your deck,”</span> Hal assured him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The signal was given, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Pollard”</span> immediately
responding. She cut a wide circle, at
good speed, returning to her former position,
where the propellers were stopped.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You suspect your own machinist, who was
aboard?”</span> asked the naval officer, in a low tone,
of the submarine boys.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“If you'll pardon our not answering directly,
sir,”</span> Captain Jack replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“we want to have
more than suspicions before we make a very
energetic report on this strange accident. But
we shall not be asleep, sir, in the matter of finding
out. Then we shall make a full report to
Mr. Mayhew.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Success to you—and vigilance!”</span> muttered
the naval officer.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The gunboat's cutter came alongside, transferring
Jack and Hal back to the <span class="tei tei-q">“Farnum.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hal went directly below to the engine room.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You fixed the trouble with the 'Pollard'?”</span>
demanded Eph Somers, eagerly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> Hal admitted.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg 153]</span><a name="Pg153" id="Pg153" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“What was wrong?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, I don't know as I'd want to commit
myself in too offhand a way,”</span> replied Hal,
slowly, as though thinking.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What appeared to be at the bottom of the
trouble?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, it <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">may</span></span> have been that one of the naval
machinists, not understanding our engines any
too well, allowed one of the pistons to get overheated,
and then resorted to filing,”</span> Hal replied.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What? Overheat a piston, and then try to
correct it with a file?”</span> cried young Somers, disgustedly.
<span class="tei tei-q">“The crazy blacksmith! He ought
to be set to shoeing snails—that's all he's fit
for.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It looks that way,”</span> Hal assented, smiling.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Artful, clever Hal! He had carried it all off
so coolly and naturally that Sam Truax, who
had been closely studying Hastings's face from
the background, was wholly deceived.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“This fellow, Hastings, isn't as smart as I had
thought him,”</span> muttered Truax, to himself.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The interrupted cruise now proceeded, the
parent vessel signaling for a temporary speed
of sixteen knots in order to make up for lost
time.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Twenty minutes later came the signal from
the <span class="tei tei-q">“Hudson:”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“At the command, the submarines will dash
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ahead at full speed, each making its best time.
During this trial, which will end at the firing of
a gun from the parent vessel, all cadets will be
on deck.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Word was immediately passed below, and all
the cadets of the engineer division came
tumbling up.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To these, who had been in the engine room
constantly for hours, the cool wind blowing
across the deck was highly agreeable.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For the speed dash Captain Jack Benson had
again taken command. He passed word below
to Eph Somers to take the wheel in the conning
tower.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Eph, therefore, came up with the last of the
cadets from below. In the excitement of the
pending race it had not been noticed by any of
the submarine boys that Williamson was already
on deck, aft. That left Sam Truax below in sole
possession of the boat's engine quarters.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The gunboat now fell a little behind, leaving
the two submarines some four hundred yards
apart, but as nearly as possible on a line.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Look at the crowd over on the 'Pollard's'
decks,”</span> muttered Hal. <span class="tei tei-q">“They're all Navy
folks over there.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And they mean to beat such plain 'dubs' as
they must consider us,”</span> laughed Captain Jack,
in an undertone.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a name="Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Will they beat us, though?”</span> grinned Hal
Hastings. <span class="tei tei-q">“You and I, Jack, happen to know
that the 'Farnum' is a bit the faster boat by
rights.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Suddenly the signal broke out from the gunboat.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Race her, Eph!”</span> shouted Captain Jack.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Aye, aye, sir!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Eph Somers's right hand caught at the speed
signals beside the wheel. He called for all
speed, the bell jangling merrily in the engine
room.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A little cheer of excitement went up from the
cadets aboard the <span class="tei tei-q">“Farnum”</span> as that craft shot
ahead over the waters. The cadets were catching
the thrill of what was virtually a race. At
the same time, though, these midshipmen could
not help feeling a good deal of interest in the
success of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Pollard,”</span> which was manned
wholly by representatives of the Navy.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the first three minutes the <span class="tei tei-q">“Farnum”</span> stole
gradually, though slowly, ahead of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Pollard.”</span>
Then, to the disgust of all three of the
submarine boys, the other craft was seen to be
gaining. Before long the <span class="tei tei-q">“Pollard”</span> had the
lead, and looked likely to increase it. Already
gleeful cheers were rising from the all-Navy
crowd on the deck of the other submarine.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Behind the racers sped the <span class="tei tei-q">“Hudson,”</span> keeping
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
just far enough behind to be able to observe
everything without interfering with either
torpedo craft.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From looking at the <span class="tei tei-q">“Pollard”</span> Captain Jack
glanced down at the water. His own boat's
bows seemed to be cutting the water at a fast
gait. The young skipper, knowing what he
knew about both boats, could not understand this
losing to the other craft.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The Navy men must know a few tricks with
engines that we haven't guessed,”</span> he observed,
anxiously, to young Hastings.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I don't know what it can be, then,”</span> murmured
Hal, uneasily. <span class="tei tei-q">“There aren't so confusingly
many parts to a six-cylinder gasoline
motor. They aren't hard engines to run. More
depends on the engine itself than on the
engineer.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But look over there,”</span> returned Captain
Jack Benson. <span class="tei tei-q">“You see the 'Pollard' taking
the wind out of our teeth, don't you?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> Hal admitted, looking more puzzled.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Do you think our engines are doing the top-notch
of their best?”</span> asked Benson.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes; for Williamson is a crackerjack
machinist. He knows our engines as well as
any man alive could do.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Do you think it would do any good for you
to go below, Hal?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span><a name="Pg157" id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“I will, if you say so,”</span> offered Hastings.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Yet there's another side to it.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Williamson might get it into his head that
I went below because I thought he was making
a muddle of the speed. As a matter of fact, he
knows every blessed thing I do about our motors,
and Williamson is loyal to the core.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I know,”</span> nodded Captain Jack. <span class="tei tei-q">“I'd hate to
hurt a fine fellow's feelings. Yet—confound it,
I <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">do</span></span> want to win this burst of speed. It means,
perhaps, the quick sale of this boat to the Navy.
If we're beaten it means, to the Secretary of the
Navy, that he already has our best boat, and he
might not see the need of buying the 'Farnum'
at all.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Give Williamson two or three minutes
more,”</span> begged Hal. <span class="tei tei-q">“You might tell Eph,
though, to repeat, and repeat, the signal for top
speed. That'll show Williamson we're losing.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jack Benson walked to the conning tower, instructing
Eph Somers in a low tone.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I've signaled twice, since the first time,”</span>
Eph replied. <span class="tei tei-q">“But here goes some more.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I wonder what's going wrong with our engines,
then,”</span> muttered Captain Jack, uneasily.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It ain't in careless steering, anyway,”</span>
grumbled Eph. <span class="tei tei-q">“I'm going as straight as a
chalk line.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg 158]</span><a name="Pg158" id="Pg158" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“I noticed that,”</span> Captain Jack admitted.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He continued to look worried, for, by this
time, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Pollard”</span> was at least a good two
hundred and fifty yards to the good in the lead.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I'm afraid,”</span> muttered Hal, rejoining Benson,
<span class="tei tei-q">“that I'll simply have to go below.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I'm afraid so,”</span> nodded Jack. <span class="tei tei-q">“We simply
can't afford to lose this or any other race to the
'Pollard.'”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Williamson knows that fully as well as we
do, though,”</span> Hal Hastings went on. <span class="tei tei-q">“And
Williamson—”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of a sudden Hal stopped short. He half
staggered, clutching at a rail, while his eyes
stared and his lips twitched.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why—why—there's Williamson—aft on the
deck!”</span> muttered Hastings.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jack, too, wheeled like a flash. Back there
in a crowd of cadets stood the machinist upon
whom the submarine boys were depending for
the best showing that the <span class="tei tei-q">“Farnum”</span> could
make.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Williamson up here!”</span> gasped Hal. <span class="tei tei-q">“And—”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“That fellow, Truax, all alone with the
motors!”</span> hissed Captain Jack. Then, after a
second or two of startled silence:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Come on, Hal!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span><a name="Pg159" id="Pg159" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
The naval cadets were too much absorbed in
watching the race to have overheard anything.
Williamson, too, standing at the rail, looking out
over the water, had not yet discovered that Hal
Hastings was up from the engine room.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jack Benson stole below on tip-toe, though
with the machinery running so much stealth was
not necessary. Right behind him followed Hal.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the two gained the doorway of the engine
room Sam Truax had his back turned to them,
and so did not note the sudden watchers.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was a smile of malicious triumph on
Truax's face as he turned a lever a little way
over, thus decreasing the ignition power of the
motors.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Both Jack and Hal could see that the gasoline
flow had been turned on nearly to the full
capacity. It was the poor ignition work that
was making the motors respond so badly. A
little less, and a little less, of the electric spark
that burned the gasoline and air mixture—that
was the secret of the gradually decreasing
speed, while all the time it looked as though the
<span class="tei tei-q">“Farnum”</span> was doing her level best to win the
race.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whistling, as he bent over, Sam Truax caught
up a long, slender steel bar. With this he
stepped forward, intent upon his next wicked
step.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg 160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Gracious! The scoundrel is going to run
that bar in between the moving parts of the
engine and bring about a break-down!”</span>
quivered Hal.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sam Truax stood watching for his chance to
thrust the steel bar in just where it would inflict
the most damage. Then raising the bar
quickly, he poised for the blow.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Stop that, you infernal sneak!”</span> roared Jack
Benson, bounding into the engine room.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You—here?”</span> hissed Truax, wheeling
about.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He had not had time to make the
thrust with the steel bar.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Instead, as he wheeled, he raised it above his
head, drawing back in an attitude of guard.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As he did so, a vile oath escaped Truax's lips.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Put that bar down!”</span> commanded Jack
Benson, standing unflinchingly before the angry
rascal.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I'll put it down on your head, if you don't
get out of here!”</span> snarled the wretch.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Put it down, and consider yourself off duty
here, for good and all,”</span> insisted Jack.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg 161]</span><a name="Pg161" id="Pg161" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Are you going to get out of here, or shall
I brain you?”</span> screamed Truax, his face working
in the height of his passion.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Neither,”</span> retorted Captain Jack, coolly.
<span class="tei tei-q">“I command here, and you know it. Put that
bar down, and leave the engine room.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Come and take the bar from me—if you
dare!”</span> taunted the fellow, a more wicked gleam
flashing in his eyes.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Hal!”</span> called Jack, sharply.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Aye!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Call two or three of the cadets down here.
Don't make any noise about it.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This order was called without Benson's turning
his head. He still stood facing the sneak
while Hal sped away.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Now, I've got you alone!”</span> gloated Truax.
<span class="tei tei-q">“I'll finish you!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A scornful smile curled Jack's lips as he gazed
steadily back at his foe.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Truax, you're a coward, as well as a sneak.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I am—eh?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With another nasty oath Truax stepped
quickly forward, the steel bar upraised.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He took but one step, however, for Captain
Jack Benson had not retreated an inch.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nor did Jack have his hands up in an attitude
of guard.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Are you going to put that bar down,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg 162]</span><a name="Pg162" id="Pg162" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Truax?”</span> the young skipper demanded, in a
voice that betrayed not a tremor.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Then you'll have to make good in a moment,
for we're going to attack you.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Bah! I can stave in two or three heads before
any number of you could stop me,”</span> sneered
the fellow, in an ugly voice.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You could, but you won't dare.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I won't?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Not you!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At that instant rapid steps were heard. Hal
Hastings returned with three of the midshipmen,
behind them Williamson trying to crowd
his way into the scene.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Just tell us what you want, Mr. Benson,”</span>
proposed Cadet Merriam, amiably.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“This fellow has been 'doping' our engines,”</span>
announced Captain Jack. <span class="tei tei-q">“And now he's
threatening to stand us off. We'll close in on
him from both sides. If he tries to use that
steel bar on any of us—”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“If he does, he'll curse his unlucky star,”</span>
declared Midshipman Merriam. <span class="tei tei-q">“Come on,
gentlemen. We'll show him some of the Navy
football tactics!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The three midshipmen approached Truax
steadily from the right. Jack, Hal and Williamson
stepped in on the left.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page163">[pg 163]</span><a name="Pg163" id="Pg163" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
With a yell like that of a maniac Sam Truax
swung the bar.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having to watch both sides at once, however,
he made a fizzle of it. The bar came down, but
struck the floor.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then, with a yell, the midshipmen leaped in on
one side, Jack leading the submarine forces on
the other. Mr. Merriam's trip and Jack's
smashing blow with the fist brought Truax down
to the floor in a heap.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Now, cart this human rubbish out of here!”</span>
ordered Jack Benson, sternly. <span class="tei tei-q">“Don't hit him—he
isn't man enough to be worthy of a blow!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Swooping down upon the prostrate one, Hal
and the midshipmen seized Sam Truax by his
arms and legs, carrying him bodily out of the
engine room.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Williamson,”</span> commanded Captain Jack,
<span class="tei tei-q">“stop the speed.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“In the race, sir. We—”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Stop the speed,”</span> repeated Benson.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You're the captain,”</span> admitted Williamson.
Grasping the twin levers of the two motors he
swung them backward.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Disregard any signal to go ahead until
we've had a chance to inspect the motors,”</span>
added Captain Jack.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then the submarine skipper darted out into
the cabin.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a name="Pg164" id="Pg164" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Sam Truax lay sprawling on the floor. Midshipman
Merriam, a most cheerful smile on his
face, sat across the fellow, while Hal and the
other two midshipmen stood by, looking on.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Hold him please, until I can have the wretch
taken care of,”</span> requested Captain Jack, making
for the spiral stairway to the conning tower.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Just as the young skipper stepped out on deck
he heard the <span class="tei tei-q">“Hudson's”</span> bow-gun break out
sharply in the halting signal.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Taking a megaphone, Benson stood at the rail
until the gunboat ranged up alongside.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Have you broken down?”</span> came the hail
from the gunboat's bridge.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I thought it best to stop speed, sir. We'll
have to look over our engines before it will be
safe to attempt any more speed work,”</span> Captain
Jack answered. <span class="tei tei-q">“I've caught a fellow tampering
with our machinery. We hold him a
prisoner, now. Can you take him off our
hands, sir?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“One of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">your own</span></span> men?”</span> came back the
question.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Of course, sir.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“We'll send a marine guard to take him, on
your complaint, Mr. Benson.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Thank you, sir.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The gunboat's engines slowed down. Ere
long her port side gangway was lowered. Jack
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg 165]</span><a name="Pg165" id="Pg165" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
saw not only two marines and a corporal come
down over the side, but Lieutenant Commander
Mayhew appeared in person. That officer came
over in the cutter.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You've had treachery aboard, have you?”</span>
asked the lieutenant commander, as he climbed
up over the side.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Rather. A new machinist, taken aboard
just before we sailed from Dunhaven. The
same fellow who must have played the trick on
the 'Pollard's' engines yesterday,”</span> Benson
replied.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I'll be glad to have a fellow like that in irons
in the brig aboard the 'Hudson,' then,”</span> muttered
Mr. Mayhew. <span class="tei tei-q">“I couldn't understand,
Mr. Benson, how you were doing so badly in the
full speed ahead dash.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The prisoner below is the answer, sir,”</span> Captain
Jack replied. He then led the corporal and
two marines below. The corporal produced a
pair of handcuffs, which he promptly snapped
over Truax's wrists.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You'll be sorry for this, one of these days,”</span>
threatened Truax, with a snarl that showed his
teeth.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Some day, then, if you please, when I have
more leisure than I have now,”</span> Jack retorted,
dryly. <span class="tei tei-q">“This man is all yours, corporal.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Truax was foolish enough to try to hang back
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg 166]</span><a name="Pg166" id="Pg166" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
on his conductors. A slight jab through the
clothing from one of the marines' bayonets
caused the prisoner to stop that trick. He was
taken on deck and over the side.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Coxswain, return for me after you've taken
the prisoner to the 'Hudson,'”</span> directed Mr.
Mayhew. <span class="tei tei-q">“Now, Mr. Benson, I would like to
see what has been done to your engines.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“That's just what I want to know, too,”</span>
responded Jack.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They found Hal and Williamson hard at
work, inspecting the motors.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The ignition power was lowered, and that
may have been the most that the fellow did,”</span>
said Hal. <span class="tei tei-q">“Yet, at the same time, before putting
these engines to any severe test, I believe
they ought to be cooled and looked over.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lieutenant Commander Mayhew frowned.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“These delays eat up our practice cruise time
a whole lot,”</span> he grumbled.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I'll put the engines through their paces, and
chance mischief having been done to them, if
you wish, sir.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No; that won't do either, Mr. Hastings,”</span>
replied the naval officer. <span class="tei tei-q">“This craft is private
property, and I have no right to give orders that
may damage private property. I'll hold the
fleet until you've had time to inspect your
engines properly. By that time, however, we'll
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page167">[pg 167]</span><a name="Pg167" id="Pg167" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
have to put back to the coast for the night, for
our practice time will be gone.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“In the days to follow, sir,”</span> put in Benson,
earnestly, <span class="tei tei-q">“I think we can more than make up
for this delay. We won't have the traitor
aboard after this.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What earthly object can the fellow have had
for wanting to damage your motors?”</span> demanded
the naval officer, looking hopelessly
puzzled.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I can't even make a sane guess, sir,”</span> Jack
Benson admitted.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An hour and a half later the <span class="tei tei-q">“Hudson”</span> and
the two submarines headed back for a safe little
bay on the coast. Here the three craft anchored
for the night.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was nearly eight in the evening when the
three craft were snug at anchor.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The bay was a small one, hardly worthy
of the name. The only inhabited part of the
shore thereabouts consisted of the fishing village
known as Blair's Cove, a settlement containing
some forty houses.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hardly had all been made snug aboard the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg 168]</span><a name="Pg168" id="Pg168" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Farnum”</span> when Jack, standing on the platform
deck after the cadets had been transferred
to the <span class="tei tei-q">“Hudson”</span> for the night, saw a small boat
heading out from shore.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Is that one of the new submarine crafts?”</span>
hailed a voice from the bow of the boat.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, sir,”</span> Jack answered, courteously.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No more was said until the boat had come up
alongside.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I thought maybe you'd be willing to let me
have a look over a craft of this sort,”</span> said the
man in the bow. He appeared to be about forty
years of age, dark-haired and with a full, black
beard. The man was plainly though not
roughly dressed; evidently he was a man of some
education.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, I'm mighty sorry, sir,”</span> Captain Jack
Benson replied. <span class="tei tei-q">“But I'm afraid it will be impossible
to allow any strangers on board during
this cruise.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, I won't steal anything from your craft,”</span>
answered the stranger, laughingly. <span class="tei tei-q">“I won't
be inquisitive, either, or go poking into forbidden
corners. Who's your captain?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I am, sir.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Then you'll let me come aboard, just for a
look, won't you?”</span> pleaded the stranger.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such curiosity was natural. The man seemed
like a decent fellow. But Jack shook his head.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg 169]</span><a name="Pg169" id="Pg169" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“I'm sorry, sir, but I'm positive our owners
wouldn't approve of our allowing any strangers
to come on board.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Had any trouble, so far, with strangers?”</span>
asked the man.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I didn't say that,”</span> Jack replied, evasively.
<span class="tei tei-q">“But the construction of a submarine torpedo
boat is a secret. It is a general rule with our
owners that strangers shan't be allowed on
board, unless they're very especially vouched
for. Now, I hate to appear disobliging; yet, if
you've ever been employed by anyone else, you
will appreciate the need of obeying an owner's
orders.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You're under the orders of the boss of that
gunboat?”</span> asked the stranger, pointing to the
<span class="tei tei-q">“Hudson.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“On this cruise, yes, sir,”</span> Jack nodded.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Maybe, if I saw the fellow in command of
the gunboat, then he'd give me an order allowing
me to come on board.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I'm very certain the lieutenant commander
wouldn't do anything of the sort,”</span> Benson
responded.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The stranger gave a comical sigh.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Then I'm afraid I don't see a submarine boat
to-night—that is, any more than I can see of it
now.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“That's about the way it looks to me, also,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg 170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Jack answered, smiling. <span class="tei tei-q">“Yet, believe me, I
hate awfully to seem discourteous about it.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, all right,”</span> muttered the stranger, nodding
to the two boatmen, who had rowed him out
alongside.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Good!”</span> grunted Eph. <span class="tei tei-q">“I'm glad you
didn't let him on board, Captain. On this cruise
our luck doesn't seem to run with strangers.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It doesn't, for a fact,”</span> laughed Jack Benson.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Hi, ho—ah, hum!”</span> yawned young Somers,
stretching. <span class="tei tei-q">“It will be mine for early bunk
to-night, I reckon.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this moment a boat was observed rounding
the stern of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Hudson.”</span> It came up alongside,
landing a marine sentry.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Anybody on the 'Farnum' want to go ashore
to-night?”</span> hailed a voice from the gunboat's
rail. <span class="tei tei-q">“The shore boat will be ready in five
minutes.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I believe I would like to take just a run
through the village,”</span> declared Jack, turning to
his chum. <span class="tei tei-q">“Do you feel like a land-cruise with
me, Hal?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I think I'd better go,”</span> laughed Hastings.
<span class="tei tei-q">“You seem to get into trouble when you go
alone.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“All right, then. And, Eph since you're so
sleepy, you can turn in as soon as you want.
The boat will be under sufficient protection,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg 171]</span><a name="Pg171" id="Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Jack added, nodding toward the marine slowly
pacing the platform deck.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Williamson was called too, but declared that
he felt like turning in early. So, when the shore
boat came, it had but two passengers to take
from the submarine. There were a few shore-leave
men, however, from the gunboat.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“This boat will return to the fleet, gentlemen,
every hour up to midnight,”</span> stated the petty
officer in charge, as Jack and Hal stepped ashore
at a rickety little wharf.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Judging from what we can see of the town
from here, we'll be ready to go back long before
midnight,”</span> Jack Benson laughingly told his
companion.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“All I want is to shake some of the sea-roll
out of my gait,”</span> nodded Hastings. <span class="tei tei-q">“It surely
doesn't seem to be much of a town.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By way of public buildings there turned out
to be a church, locked and dark, a general store
and also a drug-store that contained the local
post-office. But the drug-store carried no ice
cream or soda, so the submarine boys turned
away.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was one other <span class="tei tei-q">“public”</span> place that the
boys failed to discover at once. That was a low
groggery at the further end of the town. Here
two of the sailors who had come on shore leave
turned in for a drink or two. They found a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg 172]</span><a name="Pg172" id="Pg172" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
suave, black-bearded man quite ready to buy
liquor for Uncle Sam's tars.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Three-quarters of an hour later Jack and Hal
felt they had seen about as much of the town as
they cared for, when a hailing voice stopped
them.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Finding it pretty dull, gentlemen?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, good evening,”</span> replied Captain Jack,
recognizing the bearded man whom he had
refused admittance to the <span class="tei tei-q">“Farnum.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Pretty stupid town, isn't it, Captain?”</span>
asked the stranger, holding out his hand, which
Jack Benson took.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“As lively as we thought it would be,”</span> Hal
rejoined. <span class="tei tei-q">“We just came ashore to stretch ourselves
a bit. Thought we might lay a course to
an ice-cream soda, too, but failed.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“These fishermen don't have such things,”</span>
smiled the stranger. <span class="tei tei-q">“They are content with
the bare necessities of life, with a little grog and
tobacco added. Speaking of grog, would you
care to try the best this town has, gentlemen?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Thank you,”</span> Jack answered, politely.
<span class="tei tei-q">“We've never either of us tasted the stuff, and
we don't care to begin.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Drop into the drug-store and have a cigar,
then?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“We don't smoke, either, thank you,”</span> came
from Hal.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page173">[pg 173]</span><a name="Pg173" id="Pg173" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“You young men are rather hard to entertain
in a place like this,”</span> sighed the stranger, but his
eyes twinkled.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“We are just as grateful for the intention,”</span>
Jack assured him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Tell you what I can do, gentlemen,”</span> proposed
the stranger, suddenly. <span class="tei tei-q">“I might invite
you down to my shack for a little while, and
show you my books and some models of yachts
and ships that I've been collecting. I'm quite
proud of my collection in that line. Won't you
come?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Anything in the line of yacht or ship-models
interested both of these sea-loving boys from the
shipyard at Dunhaven. Jack graciously accepted
the invitation for them both.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And, though I have no soda fountain,”</span> continued
the bearded one, <span class="tei tei-q">“I can offer you some
soft drinks. I always keep some about the
place.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“How do you come to be living in a place like
this, if I'm not too inquisitive?”</span> queried Benson,
as the three strolled down the street.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Doctor's orders,”</span> replied the bearded one.
<span class="tei tei-q">“So I've rented the best old shack I could get
here, down by the water. I spend a good deal
of my time sailing a sloop that I have. Curtis
is my name.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jack and Hal introduced themselves in turn.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg 174]</span><a name="Pg174" id="Pg174" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Curtis's shack proved to be well away from
the village proper, and down near the waterfront.
A light shone from a window near the
front door as the three approached the small
dwelling.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I think I can interest you for an hour, gentlemen,”</span>
declared the bearded one, as he
slipped a key in the lock of the door.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He admitted them to a little room off the hallway,
a room that contained not much beyond a
table and four chairs, a side-table and some of
the accessories of the smoker.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Just take a seat here,”</span> proposed Curtis,
<span class="tei tei-q">“while I get some sarsaparilla for you. I'll be
right back in a moment.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was four or five minutes before Curtis came
back, bearing a tray on which were three tall
glasses, each containing a brownish liquid.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The stuff isn't iced, yet it's fairly cold,”</span> the
bearded one explained. <span class="tei tei-q">“Well, gentlemen,
here's to a pleasant evening!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hal, who was thirsty, took a long swallow of
the sarsaparilla, finding the flavor excellent.
Jack drank more slowly, though he enjoyed the
beverage.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“If you don't mind,”</span> suggested Curtis, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
will light a cigar. And say, by the way, gentlemen,
what if we take a little walk down to my
beach? Before showing you the models I spoke
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg 175]</span><a name="Pg175" id="Pg175" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of, I'd like to have your opinion of the lines of
my sloop.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“We'll go down and take a look with great
pleasure,”</span> Jack Benson agreed, rising. <span class="tei tei-q">“And
I'm glad, sir, that you're able to show us
more courtesy than we were able to offer you
to-night.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, that was all right,”</span> declared their host,
smiling good-humoredly. <span class="tei tei-q">“Rules are rules, and
you have your owners to please. No hard feelings
on that score, I assure you.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Curtis led the way through a dark yard down
to a pier. Moored there lay a handsome white
sloop, some forty-two feet in length—a boat of
a good and seaworthy knockabout type.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“This is a sloop, all right,”</span> Jack agreed, cordially.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Rather different from the lumbering
fishing craft hereabouts.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, hah, yum!”</span> yawned Hal, at which Curtis
shot a quick glance at him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Come on board,”</span> invited Curtis, stepping
down to the deck of the craft. <span class="tei tei-q">“Let me show
you what a comfortable cruising cabin I have.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Hi, oh, yow!”</span> yawned Hal, again. <span class="tei tei-q">“Jack,
I think I shall enjoy my rest to-night.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Same case here,”</span> agreed Benson, stifling a
yawn that came as though in answer to Hal's.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I won't keep you long, gentlemen, if I am
boring you,”</span> agreed their host, amiably.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page176">[pg 176]</span><a name="Pg176" id="Pg176" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Now, I'll go below first and light up. So!
Now, come down and take a look. Do you find
many yacht cabins more comfortable than this
one?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was, indeed, a cozy place. Up forward
stood a miniature sideboard, complete in every
respect with glass and silver. In the center of
the cabin was a folding table. There were
locker seats and inviting looking cushions. The
trim was largely of mahogany. On either side
was a broad, comfortable-looking berth.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Just get into that berth and try it, Mr. Hastings,”</span>
urged the bearded one.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I—I'm afraid to,”</span> confessed Hal, stifling
another yawn.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Afraid?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Very sure thing!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I'm—hah-ho-hum!”</span> yawned Hal Hastings.
<span class="tei tei-q">“I'm afraid I'd—yow!—abuse your hospitality
by going to sleep.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jack Benson leaned against the edge of the
opposite berth, feeling unaccountably drowsy.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, nonsense,”</span> laughed Curtis. <span class="tei tei-q">“Just pile
into that berth for a moment, Hastings, and see
what a soft, restful place it is. I'll agree to pull
you out, if necessary.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Not realizing much, in his approaching
stupor, Hal Hastings allowed himself to be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span><a name="Pg177" id="Pg177" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
coaxed to stretch himself at full length in the
downy berth.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Almost immediately he closed his eyes, drifting
off into stupor.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, your friend <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></span> drowsy, isn't he?”</span>
laughed the bearded one, turning to the submarine
skipper.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jack Benson's own eyelids were suspiciously
close together.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why—what—ails you?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Curtis spoke in a low, droning, far-away voice
that caused Jack Benson's upper eyelids to sink.
Curtis stood watching him, in malicious glee, for
some moments. Then, at last, he took hold of
the young skipper.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Come, old fellow,”</span> coaxed the bearded one,
<span class="tei tei-q">“you'll do best to join your friend in a good
nap. Get up in the berth.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Lemme alone,”</span> protested the boy, thickly,
feeling that he was being lifted. Jack struggled,
partly rousing himself.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Come, get up into the berth. You'll be more
comfortable there.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Lemme alone. What are you trying to do?”</span>
demanded Jack, swinging an arm.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Curtis dodged the light blow, then gripped
Jack Benson resolutely.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Now, see here, young man,”</span> hissed the
bearded one, <span class="tei tei-q">“I'm not going to have any more
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
nonsense out of you. Up into the berth you go!
Do you want me to hit you?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another man thrust his head down the cabin
hatchway, showing an evil, grinning face.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Got 'em right?”</span> demanded the one from the
hatchway.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> snapped the bearded one, then turned
to give his attention to Jack Benson, who was
putting up an ineffectual fight while Hal slumbered
on. <span class="tei tei-q">“Now, see here, Benson, quit all
your fooling!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You lemme up,”</span> insisted the submarine boy,
in a low, dull voice, though he swung both his
arms in an effort to assert himself. <span class="tei tei-q">“'M not
goin' t' stay here. Lemme up, I say! 'M goin'
back to—own boat.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The submarine?”</span> jeered the bearded man.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yep.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Guess again, son,”</span> laughed Curtis, jeeringly.
<span class="tei tei-q">“You're not going back aboard the submarine
to-night.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Am so,”</span> declared Benson, obstinately,
though his tone was growing more drowsy every
instant, and his busy hands moved almost as
weakly as an infant's.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Listen, if you've got enough of your senses
left,”</span> growled the bearded men. <span class="tei tei-q">“You're not
going back to the 'Farnum'—neither to-night,
nor at any other time during the next few
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg 179]</span><a name="Pg179" id="Pg179" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
months. You're bound on a long cruise, but not
on a submarine boat. I am the captain here,
and I'll name the cruise!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was barely a minute afterward that Jack
Benson lapsed into a very distinct snore.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No more trouble from this pair,”</span>
laughed the bearded one to his companion at the
hatchway. <span class="tei tei-q">“Now, I'll douse the cabin light,
and then we'll cast off. This thing has moved
along very slickly.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Eph, after having made up his mind to turn
in early, had found his sleepy fit passing. He
read for a while in the cabin, then pulled on a
reefer and went up on deck. Williamson was
already in a berth, sound asleep.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It would be a fine night if there was a
moon,”</span> Eph remarked to the marine sentry on
deck.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, sir.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The marine—<span class="tei tei-q">“soldier, and sailor, too”</span>—not
being there for conversational purposes, continued
his slow pacing, his rifle resting over his
right shoulder.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As Eph strolled about in the limited space of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the platform deck he heard a distant creaking.
It was a sound that he well knew—the hoisting
of sail.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I wonder if the local fishermen start out at
this time of the night?”</span> Eph Somers remarked,
musingly, to the sentry.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It may be so, sir; I don't know,”</span> replied the
marine.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Presently Eph made out the lines and the
spread of canvas of a handsome knockabout
sloop standing on out of the harbor.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The course being narrow, the sloop was
obliged to sail rather close to the fleet.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“That's no fisherman!”</span> muttered Somers,
watching, his hands thrust deep in his pockets.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Presently the sloop's hull was lost to Eph's
sight beyond the gunboat. Then the boy heard
a voice from the <span class="tei tei-q">“Hudson's”</span> deck roar out:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Look alive, you lubber! Do you want to
foul our anchor chain?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No, sir,”</span> came from the sloop's deck.
<span class="tei tei-q">“We'll clear you all right.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“See that you do, then!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then the sloop's hull came into view again,
as the craft headed out toward the open water
beyond.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“That's the kind of a craft Jack would give
a heap to be on,”</span> thought Eph. <span class="tei tei-q">“Queer that
he should spend all his time on gasoline peanut-roasters
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page181">[pg 181]</span><a name="Pg181" id="Pg181" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
when he's so fond of whistling for a
breeze behind canvas.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the sloop neared the mouth of the little
bay, and her lines became rather indistinct in
the darkness, Eph Somers turned to resume his
pacing of the deck.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Hullo,”</span> muttered the submarine boy, two
or three minutes later. <span class="tei tei-q">“Here's the shore boat
coming on its regular trip. I wonder if Jack
and Hal are in it? It's about time for them to
be coming on board.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the shore boat, instead of coming out to
the submarine, lay in at the side gangway of
the gunboat opposite, and Eph discovered that
his two comrades were not in the boat.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I say,”</span> hailed Eph, <span class="tei tei-q">“have you seen Mr. Benson
and Mr. Hastings on shore!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No, sir,”</span> replied the petty officer in charge.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then one of the sailors in the boat spoke in
an undertone.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“This man says, sir,”</span> continued the petty
officer, <span class="tei tei-q">“that he saw your friends, sir, going
aboard a white knockabout sloop.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“He did, eh?”</span> demanded the astonished Eph.
<span class="tei tei-q">“How long ago was that?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Only a few minutes ago, sir,”</span> replied the
sailor.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You're sure you saw Mr. Benson and Mr.
Hastings?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page182">[pg 182]</span><a name="Pg182" id="Pg182" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, sir.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“That's queer,”</span> reflected Eph. <span class="tei tei-q">“It wouldn't
be like them to go sailing at this time of the
night, and without notifying me, either. But,
then, I didn't see anything of 'em aboard that
sloop, either.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Eph was silent for a few moments, thinking.
Then, suddenly, he leaped up in the air, coming
down flat-footed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Crackey!”</span> ejaculated Eph Somers.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For a moment or two his face was a study in
bewilderment.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Mighty strange things have been happening
all through this cruise,”</span> Eph muttered, half-aloud.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Especially happening to Jack! Now,
the two of them go aboard that sloop, and immediately
after the boat puts out to sea in the
dead of night. What if Jack and Hal have
been shanghaied on that infernal sloop?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cold chills began to chase each other up and
down the spine of Eph Somers. He was not,
ordinarily, an imaginative youth, but just now
the gruesome thought that had entered his mind
persisted there.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He began to pace the platform deck in deep
agitation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Anything wrong, sir?”</span> questioned the marine
sentry, halting and throwing his rifle over
to port arms.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page183">[pg 183]</span><a name="Pg183" id="Pg183" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“That's just what I'd give a million dollars
and ten cents to know!”</span> exploded Eph.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Gunboat, ahoy!”</span> he shouted, some twenty
seconds later.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“'Farnum,' ahoy!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I half believe, sir,”</span> Eph rattled on, <span class="tei tei-q">“that
my two comrades, Mr. Benson and Mr. Hastings
have been tricked, in some way, and carried
out to sea on that knockabout. They'd have
been back from shore by this time, if nothing
had happened.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What do you want to do, Mr. Somers?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Want to do, sir?”</span> retorted Eph. <span class="tei tei-q">“I know
what I'm going to do. I'm going to slip moorings
and chase after that knockabout. What
I wish to know from you, sir, is whether you'll
send another marine or two on board, so that I
can back up my demand to find my friends?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I'll have to ask the lieutenant commander
about that, Mr. Somers.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Can you do it, now, sir?”</span> asked Eph, energetically.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Instantly. I'll let you know the decision as
soon as it's made.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Eph, hanging at the rail in the silence that
followed, had no notion of whether his request
had been a correct one. All he knew was that
his suspicions had surged to the surface, and
were threatening to boil over. It was a huge
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page184">[pg 184]</span><a name="Pg184" id="Pg184" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
relief to the boy when Mr. Mayhew's voice
sounded from the rail of the gunboat. Somers
swiftly answered all questions.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Your craft and crew are in a measure under
our protection and orders,”</span> decided Mr. Mayhew.
<span class="tei tei-q">“I think we may properly extend you
some help. I will send some men to you, and a
cadet midshipman who will have my instructions.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Will you send them quickly, sir?”</span> begged
Eph.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I'll have men on board of you by the time
that your engines are running,”</span> promised the
lieutenant commander.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Engines?”</span> That word came as a fortunate
reminder to the submarine boy. He darted below,
almost yanking Williamson from his berth,
nearly pulling the machinist into his clothes.
By the time that Williamson was really wide
awake he found himself standing by the motors
forward.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then young Somers darted onto deck again,
just in time to see the boat coming alongside.
It brought two more marines, one of them a corporal.
There were also two sailors. A cadet
midshipman commanded them.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Mr. Somers,”</span> reported the cadet midshipman,
<span class="tei tei-q">“I am not intended to displace you from
the command of this boat. I am here only with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg 185]</span><a name="Pg185" id="Pg185" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
definite instructions in case you succeed in overhauling
that white sloop.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What—”</span> began Eph. Then he paused,
with a half-grin. <span class="tei tei-q">“Really,”</span> he added, <span class="tei tei-q">“I ought
to know better than to quiz you about your instructions
from your superior officer.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, sir,”</span> assented the midshipman, simply.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Eph turned on the current to the search-light,
swinging the ray about the bay. Then, too impatient
to sit in the conning tower, the submarine
boy took his place by the deck wheel.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Will your seamen cast loose from the moorings?”</span>
Somers asked.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, sir,”</span> replied the midshipman.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“If there's anything wrong, good luck to
you,”</span> sounded the cool voice of Lieutenant
Commander Mayhew, from the gunboat's rail.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Thank you, sir.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No sooner had the moorings been cast loose
from than Eph sounded the slow speed ahead
bell. Within sixty seconds the propellers of
the <span class="tei tei-q">“Farnum”</span> were doing a ten-knot stunt,
which was soon increased to fourteen.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the seamen now stood by to swing the
searchlight under Eph's orders.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By the time that the submarine reached the
mouth of the bay the light faintly picked up
a spread of white sail, off to the East.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“That's the knockabout,”</span> cried Eph, excitedly.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg 186]</span><a name="Pg186" id="Pg186" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Now, see here, keep that ray right
across the boat as soon as we get half a mile
nearer.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It'll show the boat that you're chasing 'em,
sir,”</span> advised the midshipman.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I know it,”</span> admitted Eph. <span class="tei tei-q">“But it will also
keep the rascals from dumping my friends overboard
without our catching 'em at it.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What do you think the men in charge of
that boat are, sir—pirates?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“They're mighty close to it, if they've shanghaied
Mr. Benson and Mr. Hastings and put to
sea with 'em,”</span> rejoined Eph. Then he rang for
more speed. Down below, Williamson almost
instantly responded. The <span class="tei tei-q">“Farnum”</span> now
fairly leaped through the water.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Turn the light on the knockabout, now, and
keep it there,”</span> directed the submarine boy.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was a seven-knot breeze blowing. At
the speed at which the submarine boat was traveling
the distance was soon covered.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now the searchlight revealed two men
in the standing-room of the sloop, one of whom,
a bearded man, was looking backward over his
wake much of the time.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Can one of the marines fire a shot to stop
those fellows?”</span> asked Eph Somers.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“In the air, do you mean, sir?”</span> asked the
midshipman. <span class="tei tei-q">“Certainly.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page187">[pg 187]</span><a name="Pg187" id="Pg187" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Then I wish he'd do it.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Bang! The discharge of the rifle sounded
sharply on the night air.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It ain't stopping 'em any,”</span> muttered Eph,
after a few seconds had gone by.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Nothing would, unless fired into them,”</span> volunteered
Midshipman Terrell.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It did not take long, however, to run the submarine
up alongside of the sloop, at a distance
of about one hundred yards.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Now, we want you men to stop,”</span> called Midshipman
Terrell, between his hands. <span class="tei tei-q">“We are
United States naval forces, from the gunboat,
and you will regard this as an order that you
must obey. No!”</span> thundered the midshipman,
suddenly, as the bearded one started to step
down into the cabin. <span class="tei tei-q">“You will both keep on
deck. Otherwise we shall be obliged to fire into
you. We mean business, remember!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What do you want to board us for?”</span> demanded
Curtis, pausing.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“We will explain when we come aboard.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“How are you coming, aboard? You've no
small boat.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“We can land this submarine right up beside
you,”</span> responded the midshipman, <span class="tei tei-q">“if you keep
straight to your present course.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And scrape all the paint off our side,”</span> objected
Curtis.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span><a name="Pg188" id="Pg188" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“That has no bearing on my instructions, sir.
I direct you to keep straight to your present
course. We will come up alongside.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What if we don't do it?”</span> demanded Curtis,
with sudden bluster.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Then your danger will be divided between
being shot where you stand and having your
craft cut in two by the bow of our craft,”</span> retorted
Mr. Terrell. <span class="tei tei-q">“You will realize, I think,
that there can be no parleying with our orders.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The bearded one swore, but the corporal and
his two marines stood at the rail with their
rifles ready, waiting only the midshipman's
order to aim and fire.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Eph allowed the <span class="tei tei-q">“Farnum”</span> to fall back a
little way. Then he exerted himself to show his
best in seamanship as he ran the submarine up
to board the sloop by the starboard quarter.
The two boats barely touched. Mr. Terrell, his
three marines and two seamen leaped to the
standing room of the yacht. Eph, all aquiver,
let the nose of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Farnum”</span> fall back slightly.
Then he trailed along, under bare headway.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then a shout came from the sloop, as the two
seamen reappeared, bearing the forms of Jack
and Hal.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“We've found them aboard, Mr. Somers,”</span>
shouted Terrell. <span class="tei tei-q">“Drugged, I think, sir. Will
you come alongside, sir.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Eph quickly rang the signal, then did some
careful manœuvring. As he touched, one of the
marines leaped back to the platform deck, then
passed a line to Mr. Terrell. The two craft
were held together until Jack and Hal had been
passed, still unconscious, over the side. The
naval party quickly followed, then cast loose
from the sloop.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“This whole proceeding is high-handed,”</span>
growled Curtis, as soon as he saw that he was
not to be molested.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, you shut up, and keep your tongue padlocked,”</span>
retorted Midshipman Terrell, in high
disgust. <span class="tei tei-q">“You're lucky as it is. Now, Mr.
Somers, are you going back to the bay, sir?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Aren't you going to take those two—body-snatchers?”</span>
demanded Eph, glaring venomously
at the pair on the sloop.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My instructions don't cover that, sir,”</span> replied
the cadet midshipman.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Then hang your orders!”</span> muttered young
Somers, but he kept the words behind his teeth.
Eph veered off, next headed about, while the
two seamen bore Jack and Hal below to their
berths.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Will you take the wheel, Mr. Terrell?”</span>
asked Eph, edging away, with one hand on the
spokes.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, sir.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg 190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Eph hurried below to the port stateroom.
Jack lay in the lower berth, Hal in the upper.
The two seamen, after feeling for pulse, stood
by looking at the unconscious submarine
boys.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What's been done to them?”</span> demanded
Eph.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The same old knockout drops, sir, that sailors
in all parts of the world know so well, sir, I
think,”</span> answered one of the men, with a quiet
grin.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Humph!”</span> gritted Eph, bending over Jack's
face. <span class="tei tei-q">“Smell his breath.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, sir,”</span> said the sailor, obeying.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“There's no smell of liquor, there, is there?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No, sir,”</span> admitted the sailor, looking up,
rather puzzled.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“There is some infernally mean trick in all
this,”</span> growled Eph. <span class="tei tei-q">“I am mighty sorry we
didn't bring those rascals back with us.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When he went on deck again the submarine
boy relieved Mr. Terrell at the wheel, completing
the run in to moorings.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Did you find your comrades aboard the
sloop, Mr. Somers?”</span> hailed the lieutenant commander,
from the gunboat.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, sir.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Are they all right?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Drugged, sir.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page191">[pg 191]</span><a name="Pg191" id="Pg191" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Hm! Mr. Terrell and his detachment will
return to this vessel.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The boat took them away. It was five minutes
later when the boat returned, bringing the
lieutenant commander, Doctor McCrea, the surgeon,
and a sailor belonging to the hospital
detachment aboard the <span class="tei tei-q">“Hudson.”</span> Eph conducted
them below.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Drugged,”</span> announced the medical officer,
after a brief examination.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Humph!”</span> uttered Mr. Mayhew. <span class="tei tei-q">“That
sort of trick isn't played on folks in any decent
resort on shore. I don't understand Mr. Benson's
conduct. I remember his mishap at Dunhaven.
I remember the plight he got into at
Annapolis; and now he and Mr. Hastings are
found in this questionable shape. I am very
much afraid these young men do not conduct
themselves, on shore, in the careful manner that
must be expected of civilian instructors to
cadets.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Eph Somers felt something boiling up inside
of him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Let me try to get at your meaning, sir, if
you please,”</span> begged Somers, after
standing for a few seconds with
clenched fists. <span class="tei tei-q">“Do you mean that my friends
have been going into tough resorts on shore?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Where else do sailors usually get drugged?”</span>
inquired Mr. Mayhew. <span class="tei tei-q">“What kind of people
usually feed sea-faring men with what are generally
known as knock-out drops?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“How should I know?”</span> demanded Eph,
solemnly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You see your friends, and you see their
condition.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Smell their breaths, sir. There isn't a trace
of the odor of liquor.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The surgeon did so, confirming Eph's claim.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But I remember that Mr. Benson came
aboard, at Dunhaven, with a very strong odor of
liquor,”</span> continued the lieutenant commander.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“That had been sprinkled on his clothes, sir,”</span>
argued Somers.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Perhaps. But then there was the Annapolis
affair.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Mr. Benson explained that to you, sir.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page193">[pg 193]</span><a name="Pg193" id="Pg193" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“It's very strange,”</span> returned the lieutenant
commander, <span class="tei tei-q">“that such things seem to happen
generally to Mr. Benson when he gets on shore.
I know I have been ashore, in all parts of the
world, without having such things happen to
me.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“There is something behind this, sir, that
doesn't spell bad conduct on the part of either
of my friends,”</span> cried Eph, hotly. <span class="tei tei-q">“There's
some plot, some trick in the whole thing that we
don't understand. And we might understand
much more about it, sir, if your midshipman had
arrested that pair of blackguards on the sloop,
and brought them back with us.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Had Mr. Benson and Mr. Hastings been
members of the naval forces we could have done
that,”</span> replied Mr. Mayhew. <span class="tei tei-q">“Probably you
don't understand, Mr. Somers, how very careful
the Navy has to be about making arrests in times
of peace, when the civil authorities are all-supreme.
We carried our right as far as it
could possibly be stretched when we boarded
and searched that sloop for you.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I don't care so much about that,”</span> contended
Eph, warmly. <span class="tei tei-q">“But it does jar on me, sir, to
have you take such a view of my friends. You
don't know them; you don't understand them as
Mr. Farnum and Mr. Pollard do.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Perhaps you wouldn't blame me as much for
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg 194]</span><a name="Pg194" id="Pg194" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
my opinions,”</span> replied Mr. Mayhew, <span class="tei tei-q">“if you
could look at the matter from my viewpoint, Mr.
Somers. I am in charge of this cruise, which
is one of instruction to naval cadets, and I am
in a very large measure responsible for the conduct
and good behavior of young men who
have been selected as instructors to the
cadets. If you were in my place, Mr. Somers,
would you be patient over young men who, when
they get ashore, get into one unseemly scrape
after another? Or would you wonder, as I do,
whether it will not be best for me to end this
practice cruise and sail back to Annapolis, there
to make my report in the matter?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“For heaven's sake don't do that,”</span> begged
Eph Somers, hoarsely. <span class="tei tei-q">“At least, not until you
have talked with Mr. Benson and Mr. Hastings.
You'll wait until morning, sir?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I'm afraid I shall have to, if I want to talk
with your friends,”</span> replied the lieutenant commander,
smiling coldly. <span class="tei tei-q">“And now, Mr. Somers,
you and I had better leave here. The doctor
and his nurse will want the room cleared in order
to look after their patients. I hope your friends
will be all right in the morning,”</span> added the
naval officer, as the pair gained the deck.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Now, see here, sir,”</span> began Eph, earnestly,
all over again. <span class="tei tei-q">“I hope you'll soon begin to
understand that, whatever has happened, there
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg 195]</span><a name="Pg195" id="Pg195" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
are no two straighter boys alive than Jack Benson
and Hal Hastings.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I trust you're right,”</span> replied Mr. Mayhew,
less coldly. <span class="tei tei-q">“Yet, what can you expect me to
think, now that Benson has been in such scrapes
three different times? And, in this last instance,
he drags even the quiet Mr. Hastings into
the affair with him.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I see that I'll have to wait, sir,”</span> sighed Eph,
resignedly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes; it will be better in every way to wait,”</span>
agreed the lieutenant commander. <span class="tei tei-q">“It is plain
justice, at the least, to wait and give the young
men a chance to offer any defense that they
can.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Now, of course, from his way of looking at
it, I can't blame him so very much,”</span> admitted
Eph Somers, as he leaned over the rail, watching
Mr. Mayhew going back through the darkness.
<span class="tei tei-q">“But Jack—great old Jack!—having any
liking at all for mixing up in saloons and such
places on shore! Ha, ha! Ho, ho!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Williamson, now able to leave his motors,
came on deck, asking an account of what had
happened. The machinist listened in amazement,
though, like Eph, he needed no proof that
the boys, whatever trouble they had encountered,
had met honestly and innocently.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Of course that naval officer is right, too, from
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page196">[pg 196]</span><a name="Pg196" id="Pg196" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his own limited point of view,”</span> urged Williamson.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, yes, I suppose so,”</span> nodded Somers,
gloomily. <span class="tei tei-q">“I've been trying to tell myself that.
But it would be fearful, wouldn't it, if the 'Farnum'
were ordered away from the fleet, and
Jack disgraced, just because of things he really
didn't do.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It's a queer old world,”</span> mused the machinist,
thoughtfully. <span class="tei tei-q">“We hear a lot about the
consequences of wrong things we do. But how
often people seem to have to pay up for things
they never did!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, well,”</span> muttered Eph, philosophically,
<span class="tei tei-q">“let's wait until morning. A night's sleep
straightens out a lot of things.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Williamson, however, having had some sleep
earlier in the night, was not drowsy, now. He
lighted a pipe, lingering on the platform deck.
Eph, not being a user of tobacco, went below to
find that Doctor McCrea, from the gunboat, was
sitting in the cabin, reading a book he had
chosen from the book-case.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I've brought the young men around somewhat,”</span>
reported the physician. <span class="tei tei-q">“I've made
them throw off the drug, and now I've left some
stuff with the nurse to help brace them up.
They'll have sour stomachs and aching heads in
the morning, though.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page197">[pg 197]</span><a name="Pg197" id="Pg197" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“But you noticed one thing, Doctor?”</span>
pressed Somers.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What was that?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“That there were no signs of liquor about
them? Those boys never tasted a drop of the
vile stuff in their lives!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I'm inclined to believe you,”</span> nodded the
surgeon. <span class="tei tei-q">“They have splendid, clear skins,
eyes bright as diamonds, sound, sturdy heart-beats,
and they're full of vitality. I've met
boys from the slums, once in a while—beer-drinkers
and cigarette-smokers. But such boys
never show the splendid physical condition that
your friends possess.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You know, then, as well as I do, Doctor, that
neither of my chums are rowdies, and that,
whatever happened to them to-night, they didn't
get to it through any bad habits or conduct?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I'm much inclined to agree with you, Mr.
Somers.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I hope, then, you'll succeed in impressing all
that on Lieutenant Commander Mayhew in the
morning.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With that the submarine boy passed on to the
starboard stateroom. He would have given
much to have stepped into the room opposite,
but felt, from the doctor's manner, that the latter
did not wish his patients disturbed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Eph slept little that night. Though Jack and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a name="Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Hal fared better in that single respect, Somers
looked far the best of the three in the morning.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jack and Hal came out with bandages about
their heads, which buzzed and ached.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The two, however, told their story to Somers
and Williamson as soon as possible.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Just as I supposed,”</span> nodded Eph, vigorously.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, how did you guess it all?”</span> asked Benson,
in astonishment.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I mean, I knew you hadn't been in any low
sailor resorts.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Who said we had?”</span> demanded Jack, flaring
in spite of his dizziness.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Some of the Navy folks didn't know but you
had,”</span> replied Eph, then bit his tongue for having
let that much out of the bag.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Doctor McCrea came aboard early. He
looked the boys over.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Eat a little toast, if you want, and drink
some weak tea,”</span> he suggested. <span class="tei tei-q">“After that, eat
nothing more until to-night.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But the day's work—?”</span> hinted Jack.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I don't know,”</span> replied the doctor, shrugging
his shoulders. <span class="tei tei-q">“I'm not a line officer, and
therefore know nothing about the fleet's
manœuvres.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That reply, however, was quite enough to send
Jack Benson's suspicions aloft.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page199">[pg 199]</span><a name="Pg199" id="Pg199" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Eph,”</span> he cried, wheeling upon his friend the
moment Doctor McCrea was gone, <span class="tei tei-q">“there's
something you haven't told us.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Such as—what?”</span> asked Somers, doing his
best to look mighty innocent.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Doctor McCrea as good as admitted that we
won't have anything to do to-day. What's
wrong?”</span> Then, after a brief pause: <span class="tei tei-q">“Good
heavens, does Mr. Mayhew believe we've been
acting disgracefully? Are we barred out of the
instruction work?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hal had been raising a glass of cold water to
his lips. The glass fell, with a crash. He
wheeled about, then clutched at the edge of the
cabin table, most unsteadily.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“We-e-ll,”</span> admitted Somers, reluctantly,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Mr. Mayhew said he would want to question
you some, perhaps, this morning.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What did he say? Out with it all, Eph!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A moment before Jack Benson had been pallid
enough. Now, two bright, furious spots burned
in either cheek.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The red-haired boy, however, was spared the
pain of going any further, for, at that moment,
a heavy tread was heard on the spiral staircase.
Then Lieutenant Commander Mayhew, holding
himself very erect, one hand resting against the
scabbard of the sword that he wore at his side,
came into view below.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg 200]</span><a name="Pg200" id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Many were the questions that the naval officer
put to the victims of the night's mishap.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, gentlemen,”</span> Mr. Mayhew said at last,
rising, <span class="tei tei-q">“your story is strange. Yet, I believe
you are young men of honor. I'm sorry we
have not in custody the men who sailed that
sloop.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Pardon me, sir!”</span> burst out Eph.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, Mr. Somers?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Perhaps, sir, if you should question Truax
you could learn something from him. I tell
you, sir, there's a scheme to ruin Jack Benson;
and that's only part of a bigger plot to discredit
our company with the Navy!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Mayhew, looking thoughtful, replied:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I'll find some way of questioning Truax.
And now, Mr. Benson, since you and Mr. Hastings
are not fit to instruct the cadets to-day, I'll
send out sections under Lieutenant Halpin on
board the 'Pollard' only. To-morrow you
should be in shape to resume your duties.
Meanwhile, I must make one condition.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It will not be necessary, sir, to make any
conditions with us,”</span> Jack replied. <span class="tei tei-q">“Your instructions
will be sufficient.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“While you are on this present tour of duty,
I shall ask Mr. Benson and Mr. Hastings not to
leave the 'Farnum' without my consent.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As soon as Mr. Mayhew had left the <span class="tei tei-q">“Farnum”</span>
Eph Somers cried bitterly:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span><a name="Pg201" id="Pg201" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“You heard the verdict in the case! A great
verdict! Not guilty—but don't do it again!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At half past eight the next morning a section
of cadets, under the command of Ensign Trahern,
came aboard the <span class="tei tei-q">“Farnum.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The lieutenant commander sends word, with
his compliments,”</span> reported Trahern, <span class="tei tei-q">“that
after leaving the bay the formation will be as
usual. The signal to halt and be ready for the
tour of instruction will be given when we're
about ten miles off shore.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Six of the cadets, of the engineer division,
went below to the engine room. To one of the
ten left on deck Jack turned and said:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You will take charge, Mr. Surles. Assume
all the responsibilities of the officer of the
deck.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In all, five of the midshipmen had commanded
briefly before the laying-to signal was given.
Hal Hastings then appeared on deck.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Captain Benson,”</span> Hal stated, saluting, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
have inspected all the submerging machinery,
and I find everything in good order. We can
go below the surface at any time.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Thank you, Mr. Hastings. All below!”</span>
ordered Jack crisply.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After the cadets and the ensign had filed below,
Jack, having seen that all was in order,
followed. He made all fast in the conning
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span><a name="Pg202" id="Pg202" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
tower, then called Midshipman Surles up the
stairway to the tower wheel.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Do you think you can head due east and
keep to that course under water, Mr. Surles?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, sir.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Going down to the cabin floor, Jack ordered
two more midshipmen to the tower as observers.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The rest crowd about me and ask questions
while I handle the submerging machinery.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Under the impetus from the electric motors,
the propeller shafts began to throb. The next
instant the submarine shot below, going down
at so steep an angle that many of the middies
were forced to reach for new footing.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The gauge registers sixty feet below,”</span> announced
Jack.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In another moment, by the quick flooding of
some of the compartments astern, the young
skipper brought the boat to an even keel.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having finished the prescribed distance
under water, Captain Jack turned on the compressed
air to expel the water from the compartments.
The conning tower soon rose above
the water, and a moment later the <span class="tei tei-q">“Pollard”</span>
also emerged.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Other cadets were transferred from the gunboat
to the submarines, and the instruction proceeded.
The manœuvers for the day were ended
with a half-hour run under water.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg 203]</span><a name="Pg203" id="Pg203" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“By the way, sir, did you question Truax to
see what you could learn about his reasons for
acting as he did on the 'Farnum'?”</span> asked Jack
Benson the next day. Jack and Doctor McCrea
were talking with Mr. Mayhew.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I had him before me last night, and again
this morning,”</span> replied Mr. Mayhew. <span class="tei tei-q">“He said
he hadn't an idea what I meant, and that is all
I could get out of him.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jack looked thoughtfully at Doctor McCrea
for a moment before he exclaimed:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Doctor, if I had anything like your chance,
I'd have Sam Truax talking!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“How?”</span> Doctor McCrea looked interested.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, I'd—”</span> Jack hesitated, glancing toward
the gunboat's commanding officer.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I'd better go and see how the midshipmen
are doing,”</span> laughed Mr. Mayhew, rising.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For some minutes Jack talked with Doctor
McCrea. As the medical officer listened, he
grinned, then laughed unrestrainedly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Mr. Benson, you're certainly ingenious!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Will you do what I've suggested?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, I—er—er—”</span> Doctor McCrea hesitated.
<span class="tei tei-q">“I—well, I'll think it over.”</span> Again
Doctor McCrea roared with laughter.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Sam Truax sat in the brig, between decks
on the <span class="tei tei-q">“Hudson,”</span> his scowling face turned
toward the barred door, when the marine
guard, taking a turn, peered in.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Good heavens, man! What ails you?”</span> demanded
the marine.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I'm all right,”</span> growled the prisoner.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I'll be hanged if you look it.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What are you talking about!”</span> demanded
the prisoner angrily.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Man alive, I wish you could see your face!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Three minutes later a sailor halted at the
door, looked at Truax, then wheeled about to
the marine.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Say, what ails that man? What's the matter
with his face?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Don't know. Looks fearful, doesn't he?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Awful! Ought to have the doctor.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sam shifted uneasily.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Five minutes later a sailor wearing on one
sleeve the Red Cross of the hospital squad came
along.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Say,”</span> said the marine, <span class="tei tei-q">“I wish you'd look
at the feller in the brig.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page205">[pg 205]</span><a name="Pg205" id="Pg205" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
The hospital man showed his face at the grating
and looked at Truax keenly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Wow! The sawbones officer has got to look
at this chap!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sam Truax sprang to his feet, but his legs
wobbled. He felt his heart-beats racing and
his face flushing.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I felt all right a little while ago, but I certainly
feel queer now,”</span> he muttered.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Doctor McCrea soon hurried below.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Sentry, unlock the door! Let me in there!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Doctor McCrea made a brief examination.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“How long have you been feeling ill?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“N-not long,”</span> faltered Truax.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Hospital man!”</span> called Doctor McCrea.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Aye, aye, sir!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Have the stretcher brought here at once.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Aye, aye, sir!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The stretcher was brought, and the attendants
put Truax on it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I can walk, Doctor,”</span> he protested feebly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Can't risk it! To the 'sick bay,' men.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What's wrong, Doctor?”</span> Truax asked, when
he was lifted from the stretcher and placed in
one of the berths.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Don't talk, my man. Just lie quietly and
let us get you on your feet—if we can,”</span> he
added under his breath, but not so softly but
that Sam Truax heard him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg 206]</span><a name="Pg206" id="Pg206" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
The attendant came with a glass of liquid.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Drink this,”</span> ordered the surgeon, <span class="tei tei-q">“and in
a few minutes you'll feel better.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I—I feel awful,”</span> Truax groaned.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The dose was repeated, but the patient continued
to grow worse. His nausea was overwhelming
and he vomited over and over. In an
interval of quiet the doctor leaned over him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Have you anything on your mind, man?
Any wrong you'd like to set straight before—before—”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A look of fright came into Truax's eyes.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Doctor, I—I wonder if Jack Benson would
come to see me?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I'll see,”</span> replied the doctor, rising and leaving
the <span class="tei tei-q">“sick bay.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ten minutes later the naval surgeon returned
with Benson. Hal Hastings, Mr. Mayhew and
Ensign Trahern followed Jack and the doctor.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Here's Mr. Benson, Truax,”</span> announced
Doctor McCrea. <span class="tei tei-q">“If there's anything you wish
to confess, the rest of us can bear witness and
help straighten matters out if you've done any
wrong that you now regret.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sam Truax feebly stretched out a hand that
was hot and dry.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Benson, will you give me your hand?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Certainly.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Can you ever forgive me?”</span> moaned the man.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page207">[pg 207]</span><a name="Pg207" id="Pg207" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Why, what have you done?”</span> asked Jack.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“That assault back in Dunhaven—”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Was it you who knocked me out there?”</span> demanded
Benson sharply.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes.”</span> In a shaking voice Truax confessed
the details of the affair and from that passed to
Jack's trip to the suburbs of Annapolis.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I found the mulatto in a low den. I told
him you carried a lot of money and that he
could have it all if he'd decoy you somewhere,
keep you all night, and send you back to the
Naval Academy looking like a tramp.”</span> He
then added the name of the mulatto.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But why have you done this?”</span> demanded
Jack. <span class="tei tei-q">“What have you against me?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I didn't do it on my own account. I did
it for Tip Gaynor, a salesman for Sidenham.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The Sidenham Submarine Company?”</span>
cried Jack, deeply interested. <span class="tei tei-q">“The Sidenham
people are our nearest competitors in the
submarine business!”</span> he exclaimed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes; and they wanted to get the business
away from the Pollard Company. They told
Tip Gaynor it would be worth ten thousand
dollars to him for each Sidenham boat he could
sell to the Government. Tip hired me—”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“One moment, please,”</span> interrupted Jack.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Did the Sidenham officials know that Gaynor
intended to use such methods?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span><a name="Pg208" id="Pg208" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“I don't believe they did,”</span> replied Truax.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Humph! So Gaynor hired you to do all you
could to disgrace me in the eyes of the naval
authorities and to injure the machinery in the
engine room of the submarine!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes. Tip said it was highly important that
the Pollard boats should break down while
under the eyes of all Annapolis, so that it would
seem that they could not be depended upon.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Truax here became so ill that his audience
had to wait until he could proceed. Then Jack
asked:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What sort of looking fellow is Gaynor?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“He was the black-bearded man who shanghaied
you in the white knockabout. He doesn't
usually wear a beard. He grew it for the occasion.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“So, acting for Tip Gaynor, you undertook to
ruin us all and the good name of our boats!
You even met Dave Pollard and got him to take
you on as a machinist for our boats!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Tip knew a man who was willing to introduce
me to Mr. Pollard.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It was like kindly, unsuspicious Dave Pollard
to be taken in by a rascal like that,”</span> muttered
Jack to himself.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sam Truax added a few more details to his
confession, then said:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I couldn't die without telling you this, Benson.
I hope you forgive me.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg 209]</span><a name="Pg209" id="Pg209" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Before Jack Benson could reply Lieutenant
Commander Mayhew stepped forward.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Truax, have you told us the exact truth?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I have.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You thought it would be easy to get the
better of a boy like Benson, I suppose.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Easy enough,”</span> admitted Sam. <span class="tei tei-q">“So did
Tip.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You shot far below the mark in guessing at
Benson's ingenuity and brains,”</span> remarked
Doctor McCrea, laughing. <span class="tei tei-q">“It was he who suggested
this way of inducing you to make this
confession after you had refused to answer the
lieutenant commander's questions.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What?”</span> demanded Truax harshly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“When I was first called in to you, you were
not sick, only scared by the remarks of others.
After we got you in here, we dosed you with
ipecac. That started your stomach to moving
up and down.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What? You poisoned me?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The ipecac was my choice. It isn't poison.
The general idea was Captain Benson's. With
a lad like him you haven't a chance.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Benson, you infernal cheat, you!”</span> muttered
Truax, and started to get out of the berth. But
he was weak, and the attendant had no difficulty
in thrusting him back.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“In view of what you've been telling us,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg 210]</span><a name="Pg210" id="Pg210" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
you'd better not sprinkle bad names about,”</span>
said the surgeon, turning on his heel. He was
followed by the others, all chuckling.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Mr. Benson,”</span> said Doctor McCrea, when
the party was in the cabin, <span class="tei tei-q">“are you my
friend?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I certainly am, sir,”</span> cried Jack warmly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Thank you,”</span> said the doctor, making a comical
face. <span class="tei tei-q">“With your head for doing things,
Mr. Benson, I feel safer with your friendship
than I should if I had your enmity.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While they were still chatting in the cabin
of the gunboat a shot sounded on deck. Then
a corporal of marines rushed in, saluting.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The prisoner, Truax, sir, escaped while
walking under guard on deck. He dived headlong,
sir. The marine guard fired after him
through the darkness, sir. The officer of the
deck sends his compliments, sir, and wants to
know if Truax is to be pursued in a small boat.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“At once, and with all diligence,”</span> ordered the
lieutenant commander.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Though a thorough search was made, Truax
was not found. It was thought that the fellow
had been drowned. But months later it was
learned that he was skulking in Europe with
Tip Gaynor, who had received word in time to
make his escape also.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For two days more the instruction continued
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg 211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
at sea. Then, the tour of instruction over, the
little flotilla returned to the Academy at Annapolis.
From there Captain Benson wired Mr.
Farnum for further orders. Without delay
came back the dispatch:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Navy Department requests that for present
'Farnum' be left at Annapolis. You and crew
return by rail when ready.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Soon after this Jack was informed that the
Annapolis police had run down the mulatto who
had decoyed the young submarine skipper on
that memorable night. Jack's money, watch
and other valuables were later recovered and
returned to him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Just before Jack and his mates were to leave
the <span class="tei tei-q">“Farnum”</span> for the last time, Lieutenant
Commander Mayhew came aboard, followed by
Ensign Trahern and three of the midshipmen
who had been under submarine instruction.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Mr. Benson and gentlemen,”</span> said Mr. Mayhew,
<span class="tei tei-q">“I shall not make a set speech. What I
have to say is that the cadet midshipmen who
have been under your capable and much-prized
instruction of late wish each of you to take
away a slight memento of your stay here.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Machinist Williamson had not been omitted.
Each of the four received from the lieutenant
commander a small box, each containing a small
gold shield. In the center was the coat of arms
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page212">[pg 212]</span><a name="Pg212" id="Pg212" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the United States Naval Academy. At the
top of each pin was the name of the one to whom
it was given. Across the bottom were the
words:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1.00em">
FROM THE<br />
BATTALION OF NAVAL CADETS<br />
IN KEEN APPRECIATION<br />
OF ADMIRABLE INSTRUCTION<br />
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"I think," said Mr. Mayhew, "that none of
you will hesitate to wear this pin on vest or
coat lapel. The gift is a simple one, but it
practically makes you honorary members of the
United States Navy of the future, and I am glad
of it."</p>

            considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
            with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
            we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
